> Original ideas don't come from trying to have original ideas. They come from trying to build or understand something slightly too difficult
> - Paul Graham, How to Do Great Work

I spent a year doing the opposite.

Posting on Substack. Countless tweets before that. I studied hooks. I optimized headlines. I read "how to grow your newsletter" guides on newsletters about growing newsletters.

The result: 30 subscribers. Ten of them are friends and family.

The advice said consistency compounds. Show up. Provide value. The growth will come.

It didn't.

And for months, I assumed the problem was tactical. Wrong niche. Weak hooks. Bad posting schedule. I kept tweaking, kept consuming advice, kept looking for the missing variable. I spent more money that I'd like to in courses.

And I was asking the wrong question.

Here's what I noticed while drowning in growth content:

The stuff that performs best on any platform is content about the platform itself.

How to blow up on Twitter—posted on Twitter. How to crack LinkedIn—posted on LinkedIn. How to build a Substack empire—guess where.

It's a closed loop. A hall of mirrors. And if you're outside it, you're not learning a skill. You're watching people sell shovels during a gold rush.

The deeper problem isn't the advice. It's what the advice trains you to do.

You stop asking "what do I care about?" and start asking "what will perform?" Every idea gets filtered through an algorithm you don't control. You're not creating anymore. You're guessing.

That's not a content strategy. That's creative carbon monoxide—odorless, invisible, lethal over time.

Then last week, I did something that had nothing to do with content.

A friend came over. We took my ancient, barely-functional laptop and turned it into a Minecraft server.

Dumb? Sure. But here's what happened while we were elbows-deep in terminal commands and port forwarding:

I felt like a kid again.

That feeling of breaking things, figuring things out, hitting a wall and pushing through anyway. No metrics. No "will this get traction?" filter running in the background. Just curiosity and play.

It was the most fun I'd had in months. And I wasn't trying to document it. I wasn't thinking about hooks. I was just... doing something interesting.

---

The Minecraft server pulled me into a rabbit hole I didn't know existed.

Homelabs. Self-hosting. People running their own servers, storing their own data, building their own infrastructure instead of renting space from Big Tech.

And underneath all the technical stuff is a philosophy: sovereignty.

Own your information. Own your photos, your notes, your thoughts. Don't trust corporations to hold the keys to your digital existence. Build systems you control.

People are migrating from Windows to Linux. From cloud AI to local models. From algorithmic feeds to RSS readers and self-hosted blogs. It's a quiet rebellion against dependency.

I hadn't written anything about it yet. But I'd stumbled into something I actually cared about—something I wanted to explore whether or not anyone was watching.

And suddenly I had more to say than a year of audience research had ever given me.

---

Here's the reframe that changed everything:

The homelab philosophy applies to creativity.

I'd been renting my creative identity from platform dynamics. Letting subscriber counts tell me if my work mattered. Asking the algorithm what I should care about.

But the people who build audiences worth having—audiences that actually care—aren't the ones who cracked the system.

They're the ones who got so obsessed with something real that others couldn't look away.

The content wasn't the engine. It was exhaust.

They did interesting things. The writing followed.

---

This is backwards from everything the growth world teaches.

They say: find your niche, study what works, create content consistently, optimize until the numbers move.

The inversion: do something genuinely interesting first. Get curious. Build weird projects with friends. Fall into rabbit holes that have nothing to do with your "brand."

Let the content be a byproduct of a life worth documenting.

Because here's the truth no one selling a growth course will tell you:

If you're not doing anything interesting, no amount of optimization will make your content interesting. You can't polish nothing into something. The hooks don't matter if there's nothing underneath.

But if you're exploring things that light you up—really exploring, not performing exploration—the content writes itself. You have too much to say, not too little. The problem becomes editing, not generating.

---

I'm done asking "what will grow?"

The new question: what makes me feel alive?

The Minecraft server did. The homelab rabbit hole does. The philosophy of digital sovereignty—owning your data, your tools, your creative process—feels like something worth chasing.

So that's where I'm going. Not because it's optimized. Not because it fits a content strategy. Because it's interesting to me.

The content will follow.

Or it won't.

But at least I'll be doing something worth doing either way.

---

Do interesting things.

Let the content be exhaust, not the engine.

That's the only growth hack that actually works.
