1. What did you do this year that you’d never done before?

I've done a lot of new things this year, which I'm proud of doing. 
- I finished my degree in biotech with maximum grade.
- I started a company with some friends and got some funding
- I started ghostwriting for a real client
- I pitched the startup to some people at the Endowment event.
- I finally built my desktop computer instead of using just my old laptop.
- I paid for a minecraft server with friends, then self-hosted it and then back to the service.
- I started posting on Substack, putting my long-form writing in front of real people.
