This is a recurrent idea I've had for some days now.

And it's about creating a newsletter called Three Ideas, where every week I present three different ideas about [[Entrepreneurship]], [[Innovation]] and [[Creativity]].

This would be an amazing way of leveraging my Zettelkasten and writing practice with my special interests without leaving or abandoning my Note Garden, and without doing a whole other heavy newsletter. Just take three ideas I've worked on this week and thread them together into one coherent piece of writing.
