### One-Sentence Posts

I pitched to over 100 investors before raising my first $100K. The odds are brutal, but that's just how it works.

Most biotech founders obsess over the technology. Investors just want to see if your business model makes sense.

The difference between academia and industry is simple: one explores outward from a point, the other contracts from thousands of options down to one product that can't fail.

Pitching isn't about being naturally gifted.

It's about doing it again, and again, and again until you find your tempo.

Like that scene in Whiplash where the drummer bleeds through the drumsticks.

Most founders think the pitch will save them. The pitch is just reps.

Academia explores everything possible.

Industry, on the other hand, narrows down to one thing that works.

You start with 300,000 drug candidates. Then 2,000 in cells. Then 100 in mice. Then 10 in humans. Only 1 works.

Academia and industry work in completely different ways.

The problem is when academia is forced to act like a startup or startups forced to publish papers.

In biotech, you can't iterate fast.

One hypothesis takes 6 months to a year to test. You order reagents, wait, run the experiment, learn something, repeat.

Meanwhile tech founders can fail with 3 customers and fix it by customer 10.

This is why finding product-market fit in biotech is so hard. The risk of running out of money before is massive.

Underrated advice:

Find mentors who are 2-3 steps ahead of you.

Not Elon Musk types who are in another league.

Find founders solving similar problems who already survived what's about to kill you.

When I was having issues with my previous startup, I found two founders who'd been there 2 years earlier. They saved me years.

If you're pitching biotech investors:

- Show milestones, not sales
- They assume your tech works
- Mix YC's 12-slide structure with a story
- Practice again and again and again.

Tech investors want traction. Biotech investors want proof you won't die before FDA approval.

If I had to build an accelerator program this is what I'd do:

1. Level everyone first.
2. Connect founders with peers 2-3 years ahead
3. Bring in speakers who actually hit it out of the park
4. Cut all consultants with no skin in the game

Most programs have way too much fluff. I think founders need less advice and more relevant scar tissue.

In 10 years I've raised:

- $1M for my previous company (failed)
- $800K private + $200K public for current company
- Pitched 100+ investors minimum
- Got rejected by investors who funded worse companies

The fundraising game is brutal. Being good isn't enough. Being persistent is the entire game.

Your co-founder needs:

- 100% commitment (not a Plan B)
- Complementary skills you don't have
- Willingness to be poor for years
- No other job taking their focus

My first company failed partly because my co-founder had another income. When things got hard, he had somewhere else to go. I didn't.

What I learned cutting human brains:

- No diagnosis = no treatment = no cure
- Patients died never knowing what they had
- Diagnosis while alive was often completely wrong

That's when I knew there was a massive problem worth solving. Sometimes you need to see death up close to find your life's work.
