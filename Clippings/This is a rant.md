This is a rant.

I opened IG and the first thing I see is some smug idiot, on one of the world’s biggest podcasts, saying that burnout doesn’t exist.

That it’s just a “misconception about hard work.”

What the actual fuck.

Burnout is a very real state of chronic stress where your system becomes so overloaded it stops recovering.

It’s also backed by decades of solid research.

Here’s your reminder: don’t let idiots gaslight your biology.

You can’t “mindset” your way out of a physiological response.
