```
Your brain thinks normal life is boring because it's gotten used to constant euphoria. You see more on your phone in 30 minutes than people used to in their entire lives. You eat foods that are so sweet that, once you stop, they become disgusting. If you dropped any and all sources of instant pleasure for the next 30 days, you'd feel like a child again. Life would feel electric.
