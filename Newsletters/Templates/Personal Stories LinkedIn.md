When I [_OldLifeCompleted_], I was struggling with [_NegativeDetail_].

[_X_] years later, I just [_LifeAchievement_].

Here’s what those difficult years taught me about [_Topic_]:

-

Lesson 1: [_Lesson1_]

Back then, I used to [_PositiveHabit_].

Despite [_NegativeObstacle_].

The only difference between then and now is [_UnexpectedSmallDetail_].

-

Lesson 2: [_Lesson2_]

For the first few years, all I had was a [_HumbleBeginning_] and a [_HumbleBeginning_].

Since then, I’ve [_PositiveOutcome_].

But can I tell you something?

Those two [_HumbleBeginnings_] still mean more to me than anything.

Lesson 3: [_Lesson3_]

When I was first starting out, I was so determined to achieve [_X_] that I deprived myself of [_ShortTermOutcome_].

Everyone thought I was crazy.

But, [_X_] years later, I had successfully become [_Outcome_].

Meanwhile, a lot of people around me hadn’t moved at all.

-

Lesson 4: [_Lesson4_]

I used to be very insecure about [_Weakness_].

I was ashamed that I didn’t have [_Outcome_].

And I didn’t [_PositiveAction_] because of it.

It took me a long time to realize those insecurities were holding me back.

And no amount of success would fix them for me.

Lesson 5: [_Lesson5_]

After college, a lot of people around me said:

[_WrongAdvice_]

But then I’d watch them struggle to make progress in their own lives.

A big part of success is going in a different direction.

And remember: if it was easy, everyone would do it.
