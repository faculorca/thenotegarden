You don’t need to feel [State People Desire] to [Action].

But you do need to [Action] to feel [State People Desire]:

This one simple shift is how I:

• [Outcome 1]

• [Outcome 2]

• [Outcome 3]

3 reasons why this shift helped:

1. [Reason 1]

[1-2 lines explaining this reason]

2. [Reason 2]

Because once you internalize this, you'll start to see:

• [Smaller Outcome 1]

• [Smaller Outcome 2]

• [Smaller Outcome 3]

No reason why you should continue not doing [Main Action].

3. [Reason 3]

[1-2 lines Explaining This Reason]

Hope this helps!
