## Framework Contrarian

The most overrated framework in [Niche/Industry/Life] is the [Framework]

[Give a brief story of your experience using this framework and how it didn’t get the results you wanted].

# But since then, I have discovered why this framework doesn’t work to achieve [Outcome]:

- Reason 1: [1-2 sentence explainer]
    
- Reason 2: [1-2 sentence explainer]
    
- Reason 3: [1-2 sentence explainer]
    
- Reason 4: [1-2 sentence explainer]
    
- Reason 5: [1-2 sentence explainer]
    

If you want to use this [Framework] to achieve [Outcome], I strongly encourage you to think again!
