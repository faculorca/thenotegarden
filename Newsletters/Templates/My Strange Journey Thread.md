Last week, I crossed [_Milestone_].

It took [_X_] days. It was gruelling. But it was worth it.

Here are the [_X_] steps of my strange journey.

Hope it’s helpful to someone:

1/ [_SimpleStep1_]

When you are first getting started trying to [_Outcome_], this is the best thing you can do.

Don’t overthink it.

Don’t make it more complicated than it needs to be.

Just get started—and see where your strange journey takes you.

2/ [_ProgressStep2_]

As you get moving, what you end up learning is that:

- [_ConventionalWisdom1_] is wrong.
    
- [_ConventionalWisdom2_] doesn’t work.
    
- [_ConventionalWisdom3_] is a waste of time.
    

In reality, [_ProgressStep2_] is the best thing you can do.

3/ [_UnconventionalStep3_]

As soon as I reached [_Milestone_], I hit a roadblock.

I was making progress, but I didn’t know:

- How to [_Question1_]
    
- How to [_Question2_]
    
- Or how to [_Question3_]
    

[_UnconventionalStep3_] changed everything for me.

And here’s why…

4/ [_UnconventionalStep4_]

As soon as I started doing [_UnconventionalStep3_], I started to…

- [_SurprisingOutcome1_]
    
- [_SurprisingOutcome2_]
    
- [_SurprisingOutcome3_]
    

Which led to me [_UnconventionalStep4_].

Which led to [_SurprisingOutcome4_].

5/ [_UnconventionalStep5_]

It took me a while, but eventually, I experienced a breakthrough.

I realized that the key to [_Outcome_] was [_UnconventionalStep1_], [_UnconventionalStep2_], and [_UnconventionalStep3_], compounded over a long period of time.

And [_X_] days later, here I am.

I share all of this because I believe you can experience the same sort of transformation in your own life.

And then you’ll have a “strange journey” you can share of your own.

(I’d love to read it.)
