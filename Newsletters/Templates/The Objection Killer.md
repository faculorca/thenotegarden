I work with many [Target Audience] who have this one fear:

"[Objection/Fear They Have In The Form Of "I..."]"

Now, this is faulty thinking for 3 reasons:

• [Reason 1]

• [Reason 2]

• [Reason 3]

Even after I explain this, so many people come back to me and say:

"[Second Objection / Fear Arising From Overcoming The First]"

You can overcome this by doing [Simple Step / Belief They Need To Take / Bet].

But don't take my word for it.
