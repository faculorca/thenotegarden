The most [_Status_] [_Person/Company_] of the last [_X_] [_Time_] is [_Name_].

But if you are [_Audience1_], [_Audience2_], and [_Audience3_] , did you know back in [_Date_], [_Person/Company_] shared their [_X_] rules for [_Topic_]?

Check these out:

-

Rule #1: [_Rule1_]

What the audience cares about isn’t [_Myth_].

It’s [_RealAnswer_].

Don’t forget which one matters most.

-

Rule #2: [_Rule2_]

Most people who try to [_Outcome_] think [_Myth_].

In actuality, it’s the opposite.

[_RepeatRule2_]

-

Rule #3: [_Rule3_]

It takes people a long time to learn this one.

Success is not about [_WrongAnswer_].

Instead, it’s about practicing [_Rule3_] over and over again—until one day, you achieve [_Outcome_].

-

Rule #4: [_Rule4_]

This one is my favorite.

Whether you are a [_Audience1_], [_Audience2_], or [_Audience3_], this rule still applies.

And usually makes all the difference.

-

Rule #5: [_Rule5_]

This is true for most things in life.

Your goal should not be to [_WrongOutcome_].

Instead, you should be more concerned with [_RightOutcome_].

Then, and only then, will you follow in the footsteps of the most [_Status_] [_Person/Company_] ever.
