## {X} Rules To Live A Life Filled With {Outcome1}, {Outcome2}, {Outcome3}

Over the past [_X_] years, I have:

- [_ShockingExperience_]
    

- [_OvercomeObstacle_]
    

- [_Accomplishment_]
    

And all of these things have taught me a tremendous amount about what matters in life, and what doesn’t. (Plot twist: a lot of the things I used to care about, I don’t anymore. And things I used to not care very much about are now my top priorities.)

These are my new [_X_] rules for life:

1. **[_LifeRule1_]**
    

[_ClarifyingStatement_]

2. **[_LifeRule2_]**
    

[_Description_]

3. **[_LifeRule3_]**
    

[_ClarifyingStatement_]

4. **[_LifeRule4_]**
    

[_Description_]
