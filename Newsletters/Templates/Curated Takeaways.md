The world’s most valuable skill is [_Skill_].

But [_Obstacle_] keeps people from ever learning how to do it.

Here are [_X_] [_Topic_] frameworks that will save you dozens of painful hours trying to learn yourself:

1) [_Name_]’s [_Topic_] Framework

This completely changed the way I thought about [_Topic_].

- [_Step1_]
    
- [_Step2_]
    
- [_Step3_]
    

-

2) [_Name_]’s [_Topic_] Framework

Hang this up in your room somewhere—and stare at it everyday.

- [_Tip1_]
    
- [_Tip2_]
    
- [_Tip3_]
    

-

3) [_Name_]’s [_Topic_] Framework

I consider this the Bible of [_Topic_].

- [_Strategy1_]
    
- [_Strategy2_]
    
- [_Strategy3_]
    

-

4) [_Name_]’s [_Topic_] Framework

Struggling with [_Obstacle_]?

- [_Step1_]
    
- [_Step2_]
    
- [_Step3_]
    

-

5) [_Name_]’s [_Topic_] Framework

Finally, this is how you achieve [_Outcome_]:

- [_Tip1_]
    
- [_Tip2_]
    
- [_Tip3_]
