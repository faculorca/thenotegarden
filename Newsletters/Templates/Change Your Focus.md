[_Outcome Of Common Negative Habit Everyone Does_] is caused by:

• [_Negative Action_]

• [_Negative Focus_]

• Repeated over months and years

Honestly, this isn't something you can't always control—not right away.

Instead, shift your focus to something in your control:

• [_Alternative Focus 1_]

• [_Alternative Focus 2_]

• [_Alternative Focus 3_]

This small shift, repeated daily over years, is how you rewire your mindset.

There's no better way to ease [_Consequences of Negative Habit Everyone Does_].
