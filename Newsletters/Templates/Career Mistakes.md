I asked [_X_] [_Niche_] leaders one simple question:

“What early career mistake will you never make again?”

The result: [_X_] profound mistakes everyone (from intern to executive) should avoid in their career.

Let’s dive in:

-

Mistake 1: [_Mistake1_]

Too often, [_Role_] choose to [_WrongDecision_].

Instead, [_Role_] should be focused on [_RightDecision_].

This is what ends up making the biggest difference.

-

Mistake 2: [_Mistake2_]

A good [_Role_] can [_GoodOutcome_].

A bad [_Role_] can [_BadOutcome_].

But a legendary [_Role_] can [_GiantOutcome_].

-

Mistake 3: [_Mistake3_]

Until you’ve [_Milestone_], don’t take your eye off the ball.

[_”RelevantQuote”_].

-

Mistake 4: [_Mistake4_]

Traditional wisdom says [_TraditionalWisdom_].

But that’s only true if you don’t do two things correctly:

- [_RightDecision1_]
    
- [_RightDecision2_]
    

Then, [_TraditionalWisdom_] works great.

-

Mistake 5: [_Mistake5_]

We all think we can [_Decision_].

Until we can’t.

Which is why it’s much better to [_RightDecision_] from the very beginning.
