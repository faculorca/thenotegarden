At [Age], I was:

• [Negative Point 1]

• [Negative Point 2]

• [Negative Point 3]

My life was [Adjective].

But [Doing Simple Action] [Created Outcome] (and changed my life):

For context, at [Age] years old, I’d spend all day:

• [Negative Action 1]

• [Negative Action 2]

• [Negative Action 3]

But I started to overwrite my old beliefs with this new list:

1. [Belief 1]

2. [Belief 2]

3. [Belief 3]

4. [Belief 4]

5. [Belief 5]

6. [Belief 6]

7. [Belief 7]

Slowly but surely, I went from a [Negative State] to a [Positive State].

And if you’re looking to do the same, I hope you find this list useful.
