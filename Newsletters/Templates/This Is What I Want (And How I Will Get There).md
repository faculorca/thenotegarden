[One Sentence Explaining Your Last Achievement—With Numbers].

Now I want [New Achievement].

This is the [X]-step framework I'm using to get there:

Step 1: [Step]

All I need for this step are 3 traits:

• [Trait 1]

• [Trait 2]

• [Trait 3]

Easy when you have unwavering focus.

Step 2: [Step]

[1-3 sentences explaining what you hope to get from this step to help you reach your New Achievement.]

Step 3: [Step]

• [Sub Step 1]

• [Sub Step 2]

• [Sub Step 3]

This is where the previous 2 steps will pay off.

I'm ready to get started!
