I'm unlearning everything I know about [Topic]

Because most of it isn't true.

[Incorrect Statement 1]

[Incorrect Statement 2]

[Incorrect Statement 3]

All designed to keep us [Negative Position].

Instead, I'm embracing these simple truths:

• [Truth 1]

• [Truth 2]

• [Truth 3]

All so I can reach [Positive Position].

Who's with me?
