99% of people get [Topic] horribly wrong.

So I listened to [X] episodes of [Podcast Name]—here's how to enter the top 1%:

• Step 1: [Action Step 1]

Most people do [Action].

Instead, [Podcast Name] recommends [list 2-3 actions].

Instant results.

• Step 2: [Action Step 2]

Once you've achieved [Outcome from Step 1], then you need to:

- Sub Action 1

- Sub Action 2

- Sub Action 3

[Podcast Host] achieved [Outcome] just by following this framework.

• Step 3: [Action Step 3]

Finally, to get ahead of the 99% you need to take [Action].

That's easy to say, but not simple to do.

[Give a short story from your own experience / the experience of the podcast host].

It's hard—but worth it in the end.
