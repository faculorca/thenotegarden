I'm convinced the resume is dead.

When I'm hiring I don’t even look at them.

Why?

Because they do a terrible job of telling me if you've got what it takes to do the role.

Instead, I look for these [X] potent character traits:

1. [Trait 1]

[1-2 Sentences Explaining Why This Is Important]

Every person I hire must have this trait.

2. [Trait 2]

This can be shown through these tiny actions:

• [Action 1]

• [Action 2]

• [Action 3]

Notice these when you next speak to someone.

3. [Trait 3]

[1-2 Sentences Explaining Why This Is Important]

Hope these help—they've certainly helped me guide hiring decisions over the years.
