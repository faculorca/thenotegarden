A few controversial things I believe about [_Topic_]:

1) [_StrongOpinion1_]

I’m not saying [_SubtleDistinction_].

I’m just saying [_ClarifyingStatement_].

-

2) [_StrongOpinion2_]

Contrary to popular belief, [_ClicheAction_] is a myth.

- [_FailureExample1_]
    
- [_FailureExample2_]
    
- [_FailureExample3_]
    

[_ClicheAction_] is a fast-track to [_UndesirableOutcome_].

-

3) [_StrongOpinion3_]

“Most people” do what “most people” do.

Which leads to…

- [_NegativeStat1_]
    
- [_NegativeStat2_]
    
- [_NegativeStat3_]
    

Clearly what “most people do” doesn’t work.

So do something else.

-

4) [_StrongOpinion4_]

99% of the time, this is a giant mistake.

Instead, [_Name_] has a great framework for achieving [_Outcome_] without falling into [_Trap_].

- [_Step1_]
    
- [_Step2_]
    
- [_Step3_]
    

-

5) [_StrongOpinion5_]

Pursuing [_Outcome_] is a silly goal.

Because [_UnconventionalReason_].

[_DifferentOutcome_] is a better pursuit in life.

- [_Benefit1_]
    
- [_Benefit2_]
    
- [_Benefit3_]
