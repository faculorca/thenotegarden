The [Person] with [Interviewee] interview changed my life. But then I found

[Person] with [Interviewee].

This then sent me down the rabbit hole on [Topic].

Here are 3 more interviews I recommend (and why you should listen to them today):

1. [Interview 1]

This will help you solve [Proble] and achieve [Outcome].

Well worth the [X] hours watch time.

2. [Interview 2]

Big takeaways here:

• [Takeaway 1]

• [Takeaway 2]

• [Takeaway 3]

Another banger.

3. [Interview 3]

Finally, only watch this after you've been through the first interviews here.

This is advanced [Topic] stuff—so get a grounding in the above, first.

That's it!

Let me know—have you watched any of these? What's your biggest takeaway?
