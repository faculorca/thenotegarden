Your dream doesn't die all at once.  
  
It dies slowly.  
  
One day, you'll realize that your dream died because you chose comfort over effort.  
  
Don't let that regret haunt you forever.  
  
Most dreams don't die from failure.  
  
They die from inaction.  
  
From "I'll start next year."  
From "I'm not ready yet."  
From "Maybe when things settle down."  
  
But things never settle down.  
  
And one day you wake up and realize the dream is gone.  
  
Not because you tried and failed.  
But because you never tried at all.  
  
That's the regret that stays with you.  
  
I almost let it happen.  
  
I spent years in corporate telling myself "someday."  
  
Someday I'll start that business.  
Someday I'll build something mine.  
Someday I'll take the risk.  
  
But someday never comes unless you make it today.  
  
So I started posting on LinkedIn.  
  
Scared.  
Uncertain.  
Unprepared.  
  
But I started.  
  
And that decision changed everything.  
  
If you're tired of choosing comfort over your dream, 45,000+ students (including 200+ LinkedIn Top Voices) used the LinkedIn Operating System to finally start.  
  
Grab it here: [https://buff.ly/soidgrf](https://buff.ly/soidgrf)  
  
Your dream is waiting.  
  
Stop choosing comfort.

Slow is the new fast.  
  
Counterintuitive? Maybe.  
  
Powerful? Hell yes.  
  
People are foolishly obsessed with:  
  
• Hustle 'n grind 24/7  
• Busy instead of productive  
• Motion rather than progress  
  
But here's what I've noticed:  
  
The happiest people aren't sprinting.  
They're pacing this marathon.  
  
They're not doing more.  
They're doing what matters.  
  
Quality over quantity and impact over busy work.  
  
Remember:  
  
Entrepreneurship is a marathon, not a sprint.  
  
• Build a brand  
• Build a network  
• Build a business  
  
And most of all?  
  
Take your time.  
  
The foundation is your brand.  
  
Build it here on LinkedIn.  
  
Here's the playbook 45,000+ people use to build theirs: [https://buff.ly/wJvIV7r](https://buff.ly/wJvIV7r)  
  
Where can you slow down and focus today?
```

```
You're solving the wrong problem.  
  
See, everyone's obsessed with the product...  
  
But nobody talks about the real work.  
  
Building a product is the simple part.  
  
Selling it? That takes years.  
  
And the way you sell it isn't through ads or fancy funnels.  
  
It's through showing up.  
  
Every. Single. Day.  
  
Talking about how it helps people.  
Sharing the wins.  
Addressing the doubts.  
Proving it works.  
  
That's entrepreneurship.  
  
Not the glamorous launch.  
Not the "I built this in a weekend" story.  
  
It's the unglamorous grind of building trust over time.  
  
I've been talking about the same products for years.  
  
Same message.  
Same mission.  
Just showing up consistently.  
  
And you know what?  
  
It works.  
  
Because people don't buy from strangers.  
  
They buy from people they know.  
People they trust.  
People who've earned their attention over time.  
  
So if you're waiting to launch the perfect product before you start building your audience...  
  
You've got it backwards.  
  
Build the audience first.  
  
Talk about your expertise.  
Share what you know.  
Help people for free.  
  
Then when you launch? You'll have people ready to buy.  
  
That's the game.  
  
Want to build an audience that's ready to buy when you launch?  
  
I turned daily posts into 800K followers and eight-figures in revenue.  
  
Here's the system: [https://buff.ly/BhszdAa](https://buff.ly/BhszdAa)
```

```
The person you will be in 5 years depends on:  
  
- The books you read  
- The food you eat  
- The people you spend time with  
- The habits you adopt  
- The conversations you engage in"  
  
I'd add one more:  
  
The audience you build.  
  
5 years ago, I had the knowledge.  
I had the work ethic.  
I had the ideas.  
  
But I had no audience.  
  
Which meant:  
  
→ No opportunities coming to me  
→ No credibility in the market  
→ No leverage for my ideas  
  
Today, my LinkedIn audience is responsible for:  
  
→ 80% of my business opportunities  
→ Partnerships I never could have cold-emailed into  
→ A network of builders who push me forward daily  
  
Same person.  
Different reach.  
Different life.  
  
Building an audience isn't vanity. It's one of the most strategic inputs you can control.  
  
I spent 5 years figuring out how to do it right.  
  
Then, I packaged everything into 90 minutes.  
  
Watch it here: [https://buff.ly/T639bzs](https://buff.ly/T639bzs)
```

```
85% of what you're doing is pointless.  
  
I know because I was doing it too.  
  
All the meetings.  
All the networking.  
All the "opportunities."  
  
I was busy as hell, going nowhere fast.  
  
Then I realized something:  
  
Most of my effort was producing zero results.  
  
So I cut everything that didn't directly build my business.  
  
No more meetings.  
No more "quick calls."  
No more chasing shiny objects.  
  
Just four things:  
  
1. Writing daily  
2. Publishing on LinkedIn  
3. Building products people wanted  
4. Spending one hour a day helping people  
  
Every single day.  
  
For six years.  
  
That's when this business changed.  
  
Not because I worked harder. I didn't  
  
Because I stopped wasting time on stuff that didn't matter.  
  
The truth is that being busy feels productive.  
  
But only focus creates results.  
  
Do what I did.  
  
Write and publish content, listen to your audience, build products and help people.  
  
Here's the system I use to write and publish: [https://buff.ly/8weY0jL](https://buff.ly/8weY0jL)  
  
45,000+ students (including 200+ LinkedIn Top Voices) use it too.  
  
So, cut the 85%...  
  
And double down on what works.
```

```
The most successful people I know are a bit nutty.  
  
They believe they can build anything.  
They know their weird idea will work.  
They think they'll compete with $1B+ companies...  
  
Everyone else calls them crazy.  
  
"That market is already too crowded."  
"You need experience in that industry first."  
"You can't start a business without funding."  
  
But here's the thing about "crazy" people:  
  
They don't listen to the noise.  
  
They start anyway.  
They build anyway.  
They work anyway.  
  
While rational people are making spreadsheets and conducting market research, crazy people are already selling their first product.  
  
The business world needs more delusional optimists.  
  
People who know they can win.  
Who believe their voice matters.  
Who are willing to look silly while building.  
  
Every major company started with someone who was "crazy enough" to think they could do it better.  
  
It all started with people who ignored the experts telling them it wouldn't work.  
  
Your "crazy" idea might be exactly what the world needs.  
  
Stop listening to reasonable people giving you reasonable advice.  
  
Start building something unreasonable.  
  
Ready to turn your "crazy" idea into a profitable business?  
  
I've helped 45,000+ people start talking about and marketing their ideas right here on LinkedIn.  
  
(inlcuding 200+ LinkedIn Top Voices)  
  
Here's the entire playbook: [https://buff.ly/ALO2j0P](https://buff.ly/ALO2j0P)  
  
Once you watch it, go promote that new idea and see what happens.
```

```
You don't owe your employer your loyalty.  
  
Harsh? Maybe.  
  
But every layoff is a reminder that loyalty often flows in one direction.  
  
Up.  
  
Not down.  
  
Companies are built by people, but managed on spreadsheets.  
  
It's not personal.  
It's business.  
  
So why do you keep treating your career like it's personal?  
  
Your security doesn't come from your employer.  
  
It comes from your ability to create value anywhere.  
  
That's why I started building my own brand and business while I still had a job.  
  
Not because I was unhappy. I loved the company!  
But because I knew the company didn't owe me tomorrow.  
  
So I built skills that made me valuable everywhere:  
  
Writing.  
Marketing.  
Creating products.  
Building an audience.  
  
Skills nobody could take away.  
  
When I finally left, I didn't need permission.  
I didn't need a safety net.  
I had options.  
  
That's absolute security.  
  
If you're ready to build skills that make you valuable anywhere, 45,000+ students (including 200+ LinkedIn Top Voices) used the LinkedIn Operating System to start building their own security: [https://buff.ly/ALO2j0P](https://buff.ly/ALO2j0P)  
  
Remember:  
  
Your security comes from your ability, not your employer.
```

```
You keep doing the same thing.  
  
And wondering why nothing changes.  
  
Same routine. Same results.  
Same excuses. Same outcomes.  
Same patterns. Same problems.  
  
If you want different, you have to do different.  
  
Most people say they want growth.  
  
But they refuse to change.  
  
They want the new life.  
But they keep the old habits.  
  
It doesn't work that way.  
  
Growth requires breaking the cycle.  
  
Trying something uncomfortable.  
Building something new.  
Showing up differently.  
  
I was stuck in the same cycle for years.  
  
Corporate job.  
Burnout.  
Recovery.  
Repeat.  
  
I told myself I wanted change.  
  
But I kept choosing comfort.  
  
Until I finally broke the pattern.  
  
Started writing online.  
Grew an audience.  
Built something visible.  
Started promoting it.  
  
That's when everything shifted.  
  
Because I finally stopped repeating the same cycle.  
  
If you're ready to break the cycle and start growing, 45,000+ students (including 200+ LinkedIn Top Voices) used the LinkedIn Operating System to finally learn to write, publish, and grow something meaningful online.  
  
Watch it here: [https://buff.ly/ALO2j0P](https://buff.ly/ALO2j0P)  
  
Same cycles. Same life.  
  
Break the pattern and start growing.

```
You think you're playing it safe.  
  
You're not.  
  
The longer you avoid risk, the riskier your life becomes.  
  
Think about it:  
  
The "safe" job that makes you irrelevant.  
The business you don't start.  
The post you don't publish.  
  
Every day you play it safe, the world moves without you.  
  
Your skills get stale.  
Your ideas stay hidden.  
Your network stays small.  
  
Then one day, you realize the "safe" choice was the riskiest thing you've ever done.  
  
I see this with people who want to build online but never start.  
  
They wait to feel credible.  
They wait for more to say.  
They wait for the perfect post.  
  
Meanwhile, people with half their experience are building audiences and creating opportunities.  
  
The risk isn't publishing and failing.  
  
The risk is staying invisible.  
  
I took the risk six years ago.  
Started posting with no idea what I was doing.  
  
It felt uncomfortable.  
  
But staying quiet? That was actually risky.  
  
If you're ready to start building visibility, the LinkedIn Operating System gives you the exact playbook.  
  
45,000+ students, including over 200 LinkedIn Top Voices, used it to go from undiscovered to growing and monetizing their LinkedIn: [https://buff.ly/ALO2j0P](https://buff.ly/ALO2j0P)  
  
Remember:  
  
The riskiest thing you can do is never start.

```
Some people love you.  
Some love to be around you.  
Some love what you can do for them.  
  
Understand the difference.  
  
The test is simple:  
  
Take a few weeks off and:  
  
Stop initiating.  
Stop providing value.  
Stop being useful.  
  
Watch who stays.  
  
When success comes:  
  
• 90% want the benefits  
• 8% want the proximity  
• 2% want you  
  
That 2% is everything.  
  
Most relationships are transactions.  
Few are transformations.  
  
Build your circle wisely.  
  
Quality > quantity.  
Depth > width.  
Real > convenient.  
  
The ones who loved you before you were somebody?  
Those are your people.  
  
Invest everything there.  
  
Want to build genuine connections while growing your LinkedIn presence?  
  
I put together 90 min. of video showing exactly how I built 800K real followers: [https://buff.ly/ALO2j0P](https://buff.ly/ALO2j0P)  
  
Watch it.  
  
Then go attract your 2%.
```

```
Slow progress beats no progress.  
  
Every time.  
  
Most people quit right before it works.  
  
They post for 30 days. No traction.  
They build for 90 days. No revenue.  
They show up for 6 months. Nothing.  
  
So they stop.  
  
And they never know how close they were.  
  
Because results don't show up on schedule.  
  
They show up after consistency.  
  
I posted on LinkedIn for 8 months before anything happened.  
  
8 months of doubt.  
8 months of crickets.  
8 months of "will this work?"  
  
Then it clicked.  
  
Not overnight. Not all at once.  
  
But it happened.  
  
And it only happened because I didn't quit.  
  
The people who succeed aren't the most talented.  
  
They're the ones who stayed in the game long enough to win.  
  
If you're ready to understand how to use data and analytics to grow on LinkedIn, join 45,000+ students (including 200+ LinkedIn Top Voices) inside of the LinkedIn Operating System to shortcut the game and (finally) grow.  
  
Start here: [https://buff.ly/8weY0jL](https://buff.ly/8weY0jL)  
  
It won't happen overnight.  
  
But it will happen if you follow this plan.
```

```
Everyone chases complexity.  
  
But you NEED simple.  
  
The most underrated marketing advantage is being extremely easy to understand.  
  
Not clever. Not creative. Not impressive.  
  
Just clear.  
  
If someone can't explain what you do in 10 seconds, you're losing money.  
  
Most people make it complicated:  
  
"We leverage synergistic paradigms to optimize value creation across multiple stakeholder ecosystems."  
  
Cool. What do you actually do?  
  
Compare that to:  
  
"I help solopreneurs build an audience and business on LinkedIn."  
  
One sentence. Zero confusion.  
  
People don't buy what they don't understand.  
  
They forget it.  
They scroll past it.  
They pick the simpler option.  
  
When I started on LinkedIn, my message was messy.  
  
I talked about systems, frameworks, and methodologies.  
  
Nobody cared.  
  
Then I simplified:  
  
"I teach people how to grow on LinkedIn."  
  
That's it.  
  
Engagement went up.  
  
Sales went up.  
Everything got easier.  
Because clarity sells.  
  
If you want to learn how to make your message so simple it's impossible to ignore, 45,000+ students (including 200+ LinkedIn Top Voices) used the LinkedIn Operating System to cut through the noise.  
  
Watch it here: [https://buff.ly/8weY0jL](https://buff.ly/8weY0jL)  
  
Complexity impresses.  
  
Clarity converts.
```

```
Most creators overcomplicate this.  
  
Please don't.  
  
An easy way to make more sales is to simply remind people:  
  
- You exist  
- You have a product  
- Your product solves a problem  
- Here's how easily you can buy it  
  
That's it.  
  
So many people forget this simple thing.  
  
They post value.  
They build an audience.  
They create products.  
  
Then they never tell anyone how to buy.  
  
Or they mention it once and assume everyone saw it.  
  
But people forget.  
  
They scroll past.  
They get distracted.  
They mean to come back later but don't.  
  
The squeaky wheel gets the oil.  
  
I mention my products constantly.  
  
Not because I'm pushy.  
But because I know most people need to hear it multiple times before they're ready to buy.  
  
Some need to see it 10 times.  
Some need to see it 50 times.  
  
And that's okay.  
  
Your job isn't to convince people once.  
  
It's to consistently remind them that when they're ready, you have the solution.  
  
If you want to learn how to build an audience that actually converts, 45,000+ students (including 200+ LinkedIn Top Voices) used the LinkedIn Operating System to grow and sell without feeling pushy.  
  
→ [https://buff.ly/8weY0jL](https://buff.ly/8weY0jL)  
  
P.S. There's even a section on inbound/outbound lead generation.  
  
So, don't assume people remember.  
  
Remind them.

This year my writing business will do about $315,000 in income. Here’s exactly how we make our money & where it came from (copy us if you like):  
  
My writing business isn't a traditional writing biz.  
  
It's not copywriting sales pages, direct response emails, ghostwriting books, or publishing blog posts.  
  
It's the following 3 businesses that create a flywheel:  
  
1. Social Media Ghostwriting Agency (Ghostlii)  
  
Annual revenue so far: $169,000  
  
We write for founders and coaches on LinkedIn and X.  
  
Helping them grow audiences, book more calls, and generate more revenue.  
  
This year, most of our energy went into restructuring the offer, systemizing the business, and refining who we want to work with.  
  
But moving forward, we’re focusing on a leaner model (less operational headaches):  
  
* Fewer clients  
* Deeper partnerships  
* Equity in their businesses  
  
That’ll likely make next year smaller in volume but bigger in margins.  
  
2. Ghostwriting Coaching (GrowthGhost)  
  
This is the program I co-run with Dakota Robertson & Dale Pyrcz.  
  
Annual revenue so far: Around $89,245 (from students I brought in).  
  
We teach people how to land their first $3,000+ social media ghostwriting client.  
  
My honest struggle with marketing Growth Ghost, was I stopped talking about ghostwriting for years (even though I ran an agency).  
  
And I couldn't market both Ghostlii & Growth Ghost from my LinkedIn account.  
  
The ideal clients are too different.  
  
It's taken most of the year to try and crack lead gen for both businesses.  
And position myself as an authority in the ghostwriting space again.  
  
I won't pretend like I have this all figured out.  
Cause I don't.  
  
But I'm confident I'll crack it in 2026.  
  
3. Consulting Offer (LinkedIn Lead Generation)  
  
Annual revenue so far: $10,200  
  
Last month, we launched a LinkedIn consulting offer for people who don't want us to ghostwrite for them but want to book more calls on LinkedIn.  
  
This offer is so fresh. But it's high margin.  
  
And a great way to serve ideal clients who don't want our other two offers.  
  
I think everyone should have some form of a consulting offer.  
  
4. Digital Products (Coming Soon)  
  
Last year, I made close to 6 figures with digital products.  
  
But I stopped selling them to focus on our service-based offers.  
  
So now, i'm bringing them back...  
  
I just launched a paid Substack for writers who want my custom GPTs and AI workflows.  
  
It's only $19 /mo or $149 /yr.  
  
Made around $1,000 in the past 7 days from marketing it in 2 newsletters. Not bad.  
  
I'm excited to put more energy towards it in 2026.  
  
And that's it.  
  
Every few months, I rethink how to make the business more sustainable, more leveraged, and more aligned with my lifestyle.  
  
Next year, the goal isn’t to do more.  
  
It’s to make what’s already working work even better.

Only 2 months left in 2025. Here's the exact LinkedIn strategy I'll use to make $500K for myself and my clients in 2026 (start using it now):  
  
This strategy is simple:  
  
Stop treating LinkedIn as the entire funnel.  
  
Post on LinkedIn → Get DMs → Book calls → Close clients.  
  
That worked in 2022. It even worked in early 2025.  
  
But now?  
Everyone’s doing it.  
  
Everyone’s saying the same things, posting the same “value posts,” and sending the same tired DM scripts.  
  
The market is sophisticating and saturating.  
  
If you want to win in 2026, you need to expand your funnel beyond LinkedIn.  
  
Here’s the new model we'll be using:  
  
LinkedIn content → Long-form content → Trust → Conversion.  
  
Your posts shouldn’t just drive to DMs.  
  
They should drive to long-form content that builds deep trust, proves your expertise, and shows your personality.  
  
This could be:  
  
– A podcast that builds connection  
– A long, genuinely valuable lead magnet  
– A YouTube video that showcases your process and thinking  
  
When people consume your long-form content, they feel like they know you.  
  
They trust you.  
  
And when they trust you, the sales come faster and easier.  
  
Whether through your newsletter, your DMs, or directly from your content.  
  
You can’t fake depth. You can’t win by volume alone.  
  
You win by building trust as quickly as possible.  
  
So if you’re a LinkedIn creator still relying solely on this platform, I'm sorry, but you’re going to lose next year.  
  
Period.  
  
Build in public.  
  
And drive all traffic to long form content. Preferably video but newsletter will do.  
  
This is the only way to win moving forward in 2026.  
  
And if you start now, you’ll already be 2 months ahead of everyone still stuck using an outdated funnel.

LinkedIn is drowning in AI slop. And it's one of the biggest opportunities in content marketing history (AI slop arbitrage breakdown):  
  
Everyone’s complaining that LinkedIn is full of generic, soulless content right now.  
  
And they’re right.  
  
But if everyone’s creating garbage, then shouldn't standing out be easier than ever?  
  
Think about it...  
  
It's ridiculous that people complain abou this.  
  
AI slop isn't a problem.  
It's an opportunity.  
  
AI slop is content that has no originality, no unique story, and no perspective. It could’ve been written by anyone (and it shows).  
  
So, don't complain about it.  
Just be better than it.  
  
Don't write with AI.  
Write assisted by AI.  
  
* Write content and ask AI to enhance it  
* Build cool sh*t and ask AI to help write about it  
* Think from first principles and ask AI to challenge it  
* Develop a unique perspective and ask AI to refine it  
* Eat a hard shell taco and ask AI how to sauce it  
  
That’s the playbook.  
  
As someone who runs a ghostwriting agency writing for top LinkedIn creators, I see this every day.  
  
We use AI to assist our writers:  
  
* To brainstorm  
* To structure  
* To research  
  
But the ideas, the insights, the stories?  
  
Those ALWAYS come from our clients lived experience.  
  
And this type of content is getting our fitness client 40 leads from single posts (while most coaches are struggling).  
  
We're not winning because we write AI slop.  
We're winning because others keep writing AI slop.  
  
Because while everyone else is outsourcing their thinking to ChatGPT, we’re using it as leverage to write more, think deeper, and ship faster.  
  
The internet isn’t dead.  
It’s just become lazy.  
  
And for the few who actually know how to think the bar for creating good content that drives leads has never been lower.

I’m 31, Canadian, and run a writing biz with my best friend. We’ve done $282,264 this year, here’s exactly how we do our marketing:  
  
We use five channels:  
  
1) LinkedIn  
2) X  
3) SubStack  
4) Newsletter  
5) YouTube.  
  
And I create most of it in 1–2 days a week.  
  
Here’s the system:  
  
First, I create core assets:  
  
6) Weekly newsletter  
7) 5 LinkedIn posts  
  
Let's start with the newsletter.  
  
I write one long form essay per week for SubStack (700 to 1,500 words).  
  
I get the idea for it by looking at other top performing newsletters on Substack or viral YouTube videos in my niche.  
  
That single piece becomes the foundation for most of the other content.  
  
I repurpose the newsletter into:  
  
* 5-10 Substack notes & tweets for X  
* 1-2 LinkedIn posts/ carousels  
* 1 YouTube video script  
  
Each of these requires rewriting, adding new hooks, and doing platform specific edits.  
  
For example, hooks that work on LinkedIn don't always work on SubStack.  
  
That covers most of my content.  
  
For the remaining LinkedIn posts...  
I reference a few creators that actually post real, thoughtful content:  
  
- Matt Barker  
- Nik Broekma  
- Dean Elkholy  
- Louis Butterfield  
- Dakota Robertson  
  
On a walk, I speak my own version of their posts into a ChatGPT project.  
  
From my voice note, it extracts:  
  
* Core themes & transformational insights  
* Counterintuitive truths & paradoxes  
* Tangible pain point  
* Core universal principle  
* An outline  
* A high impact summary  
  
When I get home, I rewrite that data into my remaining LinkedIn posts for the week.  
  
New hooks. Polished writing. Add CTAs.  
  
Then I use Canva to create any pictures or text media.  
  
Usually takes me about 2-4 hours per week of LinkedIn content.  
(Including the 10,000 step walk).  
  
I used to do more carousels.  
But I don't find the ROI worth the time anymore.  
  
Once done, I extract the most shareable pieces to create another 5-10 SubStack notes / X tweets.  
  
The full content sprint usually takes 1–1.5 days.  
(Saturday and Sunday).  
  
That frees up my week for:  
  
- Coaching calls  
- DMs & outreach  
- Product creation  
- YouTube video creation  
  
That’s it.  
  
One system. One weekend. Five platforms.  
  
And if you’re only writing on one platform, say LinkedIn or SubStack, you could easily do all your marketing in 2–4 hours a week.  
  
Once you build the right content system, showing up everywhere stops being hard.  
  
You just need to start with a few great idea and let it ripple outward.  
  
PS. Yes, I use AI for this.  
  
You'd be stupid not too.

Last week, I was exhausted & unmotivated. I took a week to rest but didn't lose a week of income. How I did it without vacation days:  
  
Confession:  
  
It's not always easy dealing with the pressure of running a business, being available for my partner, and taking care of my health.  
  
- I run a LinkedIn ghostwriting agency  
- I’m building a new digital product  
- I create content for five platforms—LinkedIn, X, SubStack, YouTube, & a newsletter  
- I do my own DMs, cold emails, and am partnered on a ghostwriting coaching business  
  
Some weeks, feel heavier than others.  
  
When that happens, I stop to focus on my health:  
  
1️⃣ I do one to seven days of minimum viable work  
️2️⃣ I walk 10,000 steps  
3️⃣ I meditate for an hour  
4️⃣ I do 30 minutes of conscious connected breathing  
5️⃣ I sleep until my body says “enough.”  
  
And within a few days, I’m back.  
  
I can do this because I’ve built systems that work without me.  
  
Because I chose to build a business that supports my life, not consumes it.  
  
If you’re working a corporate job, you rarely get this luxury.  
  
You can’t just take three weekdays off to breathe.  
You burn out because the system isn’t designed for recovery.  
  
That’s why I’m so bullish on lifestyle businesses.  
  
They give you agency over your energy.  
They let you rest without guilt.  
And without losing income.  
  
Most people don’t realize it’s possible.  
  
Those who do often don’t know how to build one.  
  
But it is possible and I hope more people take the leap for themselves.  
  
Because real freedom isn’t just about money or luxury.  
  
It’s about having control over your time, your day, and your life.

Last year, I traveled to 7 countries. This year I stopped traveling to live a boring life (& it's been much more exciting):  
  
When I first became a creator, I thought I had to live the “cool lifestyle.”  
  
* I traveled every 4 weeks  
* Spent 10 days in the Amazon rainforest  
* Went to music festivals and entrepreneur meetups  
  
It was fun.  
I’ll always look back on that season with nostalgia.  
  
But it’s not the life I want anymore.  
  
Somewhere along the way, I realized that success online isn’t about looking interesting.  
It’s about being real.  
  
People don’t want to follow the “exciting life.”  
  
They want to follow an authentic life they relate too.  
  
There’s a quiet counterculture growing on social media.  
  
People who love the calm, “boring” life.  
  
They want to read great books.  
Go for long walks.  
Work on creative projects.  
Surf.  
  
Spend time with the same few friends and have deep conversations.  
  
That’s the life I live now.  
  
And it turns out, it’s what resonates with me.  
  
The chaos of travel left me feeling more anxious than excited.  
  
The routine of the boring life fills me up with creative energy.  
  
You don’t have to fake excitement to earn attention.  
You just have to share what’s real for you.  
  
Because in a superficial social world, authenticity is the ultimate status symbol.  
  
PS. It's not totally accurate to say I never travel.  
  
I do travel once or twice a year.  
Only now, it's to places I desperately want to see, experiences I crave, or to see friends I miss.  
  
This post isn't about travel vs. not traveling.  
  
Cause I wouldn't trade the freedom to travel for any BS high paying corporate role.  
  
It's about authentic living.  
No matter the form it takes.
