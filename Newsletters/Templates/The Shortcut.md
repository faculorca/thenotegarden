The shortcut to massive [Outcome] isn't:

• [Accepted Practice 1]

• [Accepted Practice 2]

• [Accepted Practice 3]

It's [Simple Practice].

I've been [Doing Simple Practice] every day for [X]+ years.

These are the [X] unexpected ways [Action] daily has transformed my mind, actions, and life:

1. [Way 1]

[Action] on a daily (or even weekly) basis allows you to:

• [Benefit 1]

• [Benefit 2]

• [Benefit 3]

• [Benefit 4]

• [Benefit 5]

There is no better tool to [X].

2. [Way 2]

Everyone talks about [Expected Outcome].

What doesn't get talked about is [Unexpected But Good Outcome].

[Summary Sentence].

3. [Way 3]

I was a very [Description Of Past Self].

And I was terrified of [Simple Task].

But when you [Action], you practice:

• Your [Noun 1]

• Your [Noun 2]

• Your [Noun 3]

The more you [Action], the better you get at [Outcome].

That's it!

Are there any other unexpected ways [Action] has helped you?

Let me know in the comments!
