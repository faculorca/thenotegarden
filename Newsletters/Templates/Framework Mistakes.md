## Framework Mistakes

I started to use [Framework] to [Achieve Outcome] in [Month/Year]

# And since then, this framework has helped me to:

- [Outcome 1 + Explanation]
    
- [Outcome 2 + Explanation]
    
- [Outcome 3 + Explanation]
    

# Unfortunately, most people make these [Number] mistakes when they use [Framework]:

- [Mistake 1 + How To Solve it]
    
- [Mistake 2 + How To Solve it]
    
- [Mistake 3 + How To Solve it]
    
- [Mistake 4 + How To Solve it]
    
- [Mistake 5 + How To Solve it]
    

Fix these mistakes and you will maximize the benefits of this framework.
