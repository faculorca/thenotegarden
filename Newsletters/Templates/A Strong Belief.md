After [Achievement / Action] over [X] years, I have one strongly held belief:

[Belief]

When you [Achievement / Action]:

1. You build [Skill]

2. You learn how to manage [Negative Situation]

3. You choose to [Positive Outcome]

Is this easy?

No.

Is it worth it?

100%.

In the end, all that matters is you're creating an [Outcome related to Belief].
