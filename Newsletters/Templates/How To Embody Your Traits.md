## [X] Character Traits I Want To Embody In [Year] (And The Questions I'm Asking To Help Me Do So)

Last year, I focused on [Old Trait 1], [Old Trait 2], and [Old Trait 3].

This year, I'm focusing on these [X]:

- [New Trait 1]
    
- [New Trait 2]
    
- [New Trait 3]
    

I'm hoping they'll help me achieve [Outcome].

To focus on these traits, I'm journaling on these [X] questions every week:

1. **[Question 1 Relating To New Trait 1]**. [2-3 Sentences Explaining Why You've Chosen This Question]
    
2. **[Question 1 Relating To New Trait 2]**. [2-3 Sentences Explaining Why You've Chosen This Question]
