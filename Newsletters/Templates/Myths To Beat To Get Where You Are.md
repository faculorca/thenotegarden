This is unreal.

[Achievement You Want To Celebrate]

When I first launched [X], I didn't think I'd get to this point.

And to this today, I still feel like I'm getting started.

So I want to thank [Audience / Mentors / Community] for all your help.

And, if you want to achieve the same, here are some myths about building [X] you need to immediately stop believing:

• Myth 1: [Myth]

Everyone believes this, but it isn't true.

[Stat/Evidence Of Why This Isn't True]

• Myth 2: [Myth]

Here's why this is a faulty belief:

- [Reason 1]

- [Reason 2]

- [Reason 3]

• Myth 3: [Myth]

Believing this in the beginning meant I made a ton of mistakes.

[Mistake 1 in one sentence]

[Mistake 2 in one sentence]

Once I realised [Myth] wasn't true, everything changed.

[Positive Outcome 1] and [Positive Outcome 2].

Don't make the same mistakes I did.
