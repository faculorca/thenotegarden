The [_Niche_] industry is on fire.

Some stats that will blow your mind:

1. [_Stat1_]

2. [_Stat2_]

3. [_Stat3_]

But it’s not until you break each of these down that you realize how quickly the [_Niche_] industry is really growing:

-

1. [_Stat1_]

This is an impressive stat at face value.

But what’s 10x more impressive is [_SecondaryStat_].

That’s [_X_] times bigger than [_ComparableIndustry_].

This is a signal of where things might be headed.

-

2. [_Stat2_]

The last time an industry saw growth like this, it was in [_Date_] when [_Niche_] was [_Outcome_].

I’m betting the same thing will happen again here.

-

3. [_Stat3_]

As if the above wasn’t impressive enough, this stat is just mind-boggling.

To give you a sense of how big that is, that’s [_EverydayComparison1_].

Or [_EverydayComparison2_].

-

My guess?

[_Niche_] is going to eventually overtake [_ComparableIndustry1_] the same way [_Niche_] overtook [_ComparableIndustry2_].

And at this rate, that will probably happen by [_Date_].

What do you think? Do you agree? Disagree?
