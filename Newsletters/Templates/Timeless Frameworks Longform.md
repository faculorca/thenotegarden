## Want To {Outcome}? Here Are {Status} {Person/Company}’s {X} Rules For {Topic}

The most [_Status_] [_Person/Company_] of the last [_X_] [_Time_] is [_Name_].

But back in [_Date_], [_Person/Company_] shared their [_X_] rules for [_Topic_]. And these rules are a must-read for [_Audience1_], [_Audience2_], and [_Audience3_] who want to [_Outcome_]. (If you haven’t read this yet, get ready—because this is one of those rare gems on the Internet.)

Here’s the breakdown:

**Rule #1: [_Rule1_]**

[_Person/Company_] reminds us that what people care about isn’t [_Myth_].

It’s actually [_RealAnswer_]. Because [_Reason1_], [_Reason2_], and [_Reason3_]. We all know these things “in theory,” we just forget them in the moment.

You have to actively remind yourself what matters most.

**Rule #2: [_Rule2_]**

Most people who try to [_Outcome_] think [_Myth_].

When actually, it’s usually the opposite. And the reason is because [_Reason_]. So, don’t fall into the trap most people do.

[_RepeatRule2_]

**Rule #3: [_Rule3_]**

It takes people a long time to learn this one.

Success is not about [_WrongAnswer_]. Instead, it’s about practicing [_Rule3_] over and over again—until one day, you achieve [_Outcome_].

**Rule #4: [_Rule4_]**

This one is my favorite.

Whether you are a [_Audience1_], [_Audience2_], or [_Audience3_], this rule still applies. You have to [_RepeatRule4_] to achieve [_Outcome_].

And usually makes all the difference.

**Rule #5: [_Rule5_]**

This is true for most things in life.

Your goal should not be to [_WrongOutcome_]. Instead, you should be more concerned with [_RightOutcome_].

Then, and only then, will you follow in the footsteps of the most [_Status_] [_Person/Company_] ever.
