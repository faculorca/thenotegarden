[_Topic_] 101

Over the past [_X_] years, I have [_ShortCredibilityStatement_].

And I use the same [_X_][_Technique_] every time:

-

[_Technique_] #1: [_Name_]

How it works:

- [_Step1_]
    
- [_Step2_]
    
- [_Step3_]
    

This simple [_Technique_] allows you to achieve [_Outcome_].

-

[_Technique_] #2: [_Name_]

How it works:

- [_Step1_]
    
- [_Step2_]
    
- [_Step3_]
    

Quick note: Don't do [_WrongStep_]. That's a mistake. These steps work better.

-

[_Technique_] #3: [_Name_]

How it works:

- Avoid doing [_X_]
    
- Do [_Y_] instead
    
- If you avoid [_X_] and do [_Y_], you'll unlock [_Z_] outcome.
    

Easy, right?

-

[_Technique_] #4: [_Name_]

How it works:

- [_Step1_]
    
- [_Step2_]
    
- [_Step3_]
    

Do these 3 things, and you'll be wildly successful.

-

[_Technique_] #5: [_Name_]

How it works:

- [_Tip1_]
    
- [_Tip2_]
    
- [_Tip3_]
    

That’s it!

Let me know which one of these [_Techniques_] you found most helpful in the comments.

Happy to do another post going into more depth on whichever one you find most interesting.
