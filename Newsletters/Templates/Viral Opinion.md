## {X} Controversial Opinions On {Topic} 99% Of The World Agrees With—But I Do Not

I have been interested in [_Topic_] for a long time.

And over the past [_NumberOfYears_], I have come across a lot of strong opinions about [_Topic_] that, at first I agreed with, and then the more I learned and educated myself the more I disagreed with. Until eventually, I reached a point where I felt like the only reason these beliefs had become mainstream and commonly accepted was because “a lot of other people” agreed with them too.

So, I have some controversial opinions I’d like to share on [_Topic_] after [_X_] hours immersing myself in the subject:

1. **[_StrongOpinion1_]**
    

I’m not saying [_SubtleDistinction_].

I’m just saying [_ClarifyingStatement_].

2. **[_StrongOpinion2_]**
    

Contrary to popular belief, [_ClicheAction_] is a myth.

- [_FailureExample1_]
    
- [_FailureExample2_]
    
- [_FailureExample3_]
    

[_ClicheAction_] is a fast-track to [_UndesirableOutcome_].

3. **[_StrongOpinion3_]**
    

“Most people” do what “most people” do.

Which leads to…

- [_NegativeStat1_]
    
- [_NegativeStat2_]
    
- [_NegativeStat3_]
    

Clearly what “most people do” doesn’t work.

So do something else.

4. **[_StrongOpinion4_]**
    

99% of the time, this is a giant mistake.

Instead, [_Name_] has a great framework for achieving [_Outcome_] without falling into [_Trap_].

- [_Step1_]
    
- [_Step2_]
    
- [_Step3_]
    

5. **[_StrongOpinion5_]**
    

Pursuing [_Outcome_] is a silly goal.

Because [_UnconventionalReason_].

[_DifferentOutcome_] is a better pursuit in life.

- [_Benefit1_]
    
- [_Benefit2_]
    
- [_Benefit3_]
