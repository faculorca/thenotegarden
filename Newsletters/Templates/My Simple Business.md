My [Business/Service] just [Milestone].

This is [Benefit e.g. 2x your previous income].

But that job required [Large Input].

This business requires [Small Input].

Here's the breakdown of how it works:

The [Business] is remarkably simple:

• [Step 1]

• [Step 2]

• [Step 3]

That's it.

And the most elegant part about it?

• [Benefit of This Model 1]

• [Benefit of This Model 2]

• [Benefit of This Model 3]

• [Growth Lever 2]

• [Growth Lever 3]

Can't wait to get started!
