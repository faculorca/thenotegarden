## {X} Profound Career Mistakes Everyone (From Intern To Executive) Should Avoid In Their Career

A few [_Time_] ago, I asked [_X_] [_Niche_] leaders one simple question:

“What early career mistake will you never make again?”

What I ended up walking away with was a messy notepad full of notes, a completely new way of seeing the world, and [_X_] profound mistakes everyone (from intern to executive) should avoid in their career.

Let’s dive in:

**Mistake #1: [_Mistake1_]**

Too often, [_Role_] choose to [_WrongDecision_].

They [_WhyDecision_]. They think [_Logic_]. Only to end up [_BadOutcome_].

Instead, [_Role_] should be focused on [_RightDecision_].

This is what ends up leading to [_PositiveOutcome_], [_PositiveOutcome_], and [_PositiveOutcome_].

**Mistake #2:** [_Mistake2_]

A good [_Role_] can [_GoodOutcome_].

A bad [_Role_] can [_BadOutcome_].

But a legendary [_Role_] can [_GiantOutcome_].

Don’t get it confused: a [_GoodOutcome_] is good, but it’s far from what makes the most difference.

**Mistake #3: [_Mistake3_]**

Until you’ve [_Milestone_], don’t take your eye off the ball.

[_”RelevantQuote”_].

To this day, I hang this quote up on my wall because it reminds me [_Takeaway_].

**Mistake #4: [_Mistake4_]**

Traditional wisdom says [_TraditionalWisdom_].

But that’s only true if you don’t do two things correctly:

- [_RightDecision1_]
    
- [_RightDecision2_]
    

Then, [_TraditionalWisdom_] works great.

**Mistake #5: [_Mistake5_]**

We all think we can [_Decision_].

We all think we have unlimited [_Resource_].

We all think we are immune to [_Disaster_].

But the truth is, we’re not.

Which is why it’s much better to operate from first principles, and [_RightDecision_] from the very beginning.
