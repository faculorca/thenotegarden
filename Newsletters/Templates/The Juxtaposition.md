```
Stop [Verb]:

• To [Outcome Everyone Chases 1]

• To [Outcome Everyone Chases 2]

• To [Outcome Everyone Chases 3]

Start [Verb]:

• [Outcome Everyone Undervalues 1]

• [Outcome Everyone Undervalues 2]

• [Outcome Everyone Undervalues 3]

Then, watch what happens.

When you focus on the last 3, the first 3 happen automatically.

How do I know?

Because in the last [X] years, I have:

• [Achievement 1]

• [Achievement 2]

• [Achievement 3]

All because I started [Verb] with the goal of [Undervalued Outcome 1], [Undervalued Outcome 2], & [Undervalued Outcome 3].

Give it a try and let me know how it goes for you.
