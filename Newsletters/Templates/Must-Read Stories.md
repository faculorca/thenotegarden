## 3 [Fiction Books/Novels/Short-Stories] That Changed My Views On [Topic]

Most people misunderstand [Topic].

And that's because they stick to the same sources of information (like [Example 1], [Example 2], [Example 3]).

But I learned the most about [Topic] by reading these 3 pieces of fiction:

# [Resource] #1: [_Title_] by [Author]

This story taught me about [Sub-Topic].

Here are some of the golden nuggets I took away from it:

- [Golden Nugget #1]
    
- [Golden Nugget #2]
    
- [Golden Nugget #3]
    

Highly recommend this one.

# [Resource] #2: [_Title_] by [Author]

I started reading this [Fiction/Short Story] because [Reason].

My biggest takeaways from this were [write out 3 takeaways here].

# [Resource] #3: [_Title_] by [Author]

Finally, I'd recommend [Title] to anyone who wants to understand more about [Topic].

This helped me see how people make 3 major mistakes about [Topic]:

- [Mistake 1]
    
- [Mistake 2]
    
- [Mistake 3]
    

I highly recommend reading these 3 if you want to get under the skin of [Topic].
