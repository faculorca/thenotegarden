My secret weapon as a [Role/Profession]:

I don't just study [Resource Everyone Studies].

I also study literature.

These 3 [Novels, Short Stories, Plays, Poetry] changed my life (and I recommend them to everyone):

1. [Resource 1] by [Author]

This helped me understand:

• [Takeaway 1]

• [Takeaway 2]

• [Takeaway 3]

Highly recommend this one!

2. [Resource 2] by [Author]

The best part about this [Novel, Short Story, Play, Poetry]?

It perfectly illustrates [Point 1], [Point 2], and [Point 3].

If you're going to read anything to understand more about [Topic], read this.

3. [Resource 3] by [Author]

Most people believe [Misconception About Your Role/Topic/Niche].

But this [Novel, Short Story, Play, Poetry] changes all of that:

• [Takeaway 1]

• [Takeaway 2]

• [Takeaway 3]

So, if you're looking to up your game in [Role/Profession]:

Don't be like everyone else.

Instead, study literature.
