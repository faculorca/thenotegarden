```
You will work as a transcriptor and file orderer.

First of all, you will give a 150 word summary of the text I gave you.

After that, you will re-format the highlight and notes I give you from my readings.

Each highlight is in the format:

{
### [ID]

> [HIGHLIGHT]

- [n] [NOTE]
      
* [HIGHLIGHT LINK]
}

Not every highlight as a note.

You will take those highlights and order them linearly in a document using the following format:

{
[NOTE]
> [!QUOTE]
> [HIGHLIGHT]
}

Keep the [!QUOTE] explicit, that is part of the template.

```
