## 2 Books On {Topic} That Disagree With Each Other (And Why You Should Read Both)

2 of the most famous books on [_Topic_] say very different things:

- **Book #1:** [_Book Title_] by [_Author Name_]
    
- **Book #2:** [_Book Title_] by [_Author Name_]
    

The question most people ask is: "Well which one should I read?"

My answer is: both!

Because even though they disagree with each other, there is a lot we can learn from both authors and their respective POVs.

Here are some of my biggest takeaways from both

# [_Book Title #1_]

- [_Takeaway #1_]
    
- [_Takeaway #2_]
    
- [_Takeaway #3_]
    

# [_Book Title #2_]

- [_Takeaway #1_]
    
- [_Takeaway #2_]
    
- [_Takeaway #3_]
    

Being able to "hold" these opposing views at the same time is important when stress-testing ideas.
