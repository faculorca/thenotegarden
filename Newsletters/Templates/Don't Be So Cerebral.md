# Don't Be So Cerebral

_This is day 8/100 of writing one article every workday. So far, it’s been an exciting process. I’ve decided to leave weekends free of writing articles and focus on self-assessment and enjoying/resting with family and friends. I truly recommend starting a 100DAY challenge following your interests._

We were trained to create stuff from our heads, being as intellectual and smart as possible.

- Do proper research
- Aim for getting high grades
- Study for tests, learning is second-hand
- Write in an objective and unpersonal way

Institutions reward and encourage workers and students to be on the analytical side of their brain most of the time. Yet, the emotional part is what people connect the most with. Is the place where hunches, hypotheses and passions are born. Great ideas need those.

I know this firsthand as I studied sciences, that means that I’m part of one of the most indoctrinated groups of society. Institutions teach us not only how to do science, but to _think science_.

In the academy, _thinking science_ is presented as cold, objective and purely analytical. But that’s not the reality. Science needs an emotional appeal, where would hypotheses come from if not common sense, intuition and imagination? That’s not that _objective_ if we say so.

So why not acknowledge this in our creative work? Instead of living only in our analytical headspace, we can embrace the power of emotional appeal.

Randy Olson, in _Don’t Be Such a Scientist_, describes the **Four Organs of Communication**, split into two camps: analytical and emotional.

## The Four Organs of Communication

### Analytical Appeal

1. **The Head** – The home of brainiacs.

This “organ” is characterized for a large amount of logic and analysis. When we try to think our way out of a problem, this is the main part we are using. “Think before you act” are the words analytical people live by.

### Emotional Appeal

Beneath our heads lie spontaneity and intuition. They are the opposite part of the spectrum. They are have a way higher risk (for not being well thought through), but in them hides the potential for something extraordinary.

2. **The Heart** – Home of the passionate. People driven by the heart are emotional, deeply connected with their feelings, sentimental and crippled by love. Sincerity comes from the region of the heart.

3. **The Gut** – Where humor and instinct comes from (having a gut feeling about something). As we get farther from the head, people driven by their gut is less rational and prone to being impulsive and spontaneous. These are the “just do it” people.

4. **The Groin** – Countless men and women have risked and lost everything in their lives out of passion. There’s no logic here, yet the power is enormous and the dynamics universal (everybody understand sex).

The power of the emotional side of ourselves is way more powerful than we often think. So, maybe, we can drop the spreadsheets from time to time and try to get the most amount of ideas we can from lower places.

That is where we can imagine _what could be_ and reach for the most risky, bold and exciting ideas. We can later pull them up for an analytical perspective on those ideas.

Probably 99% of the ideas we create from that places will get scrapped, but if we can bring just 1 idea that is an outlier, it’s well worth it.
