Everything clicked for me when I realized:

It has never been easier to win.

5 reminders that you can enter the top 1% of [_Category/Niche/Industry_] with just a *tiny* bit of patience:

1. [_Stat 1 About Your Category/Niche/Industry_].

If you do [_Action Around Stat 1_] for [_Time Period_], you're already in the top [_X_]%.

2. [_Stat 2 About Your Category/Niche/Industry_].

Everyone spends time doing [_Distraction_].

But if they put in a small about of effort and did [_Action Around Stat 2_] for [_Time Period_], they'd be a lot further forward and move from the bottom [_X_]% to the top [_Y_]%.

3. [_Stat 3 About Your Category/Niche/Industry_].

Another great example.

If you do [_Action Around Stat 3_] for [_Time Period_], you're already in the top [_X_]%.
