Here are the tools I wish I had started using earlier.

## [X] tools you need to reach [Milestone]

- **Tool 1: [Tool].** [1-2 Sentences Explaining Tool].
    
- **Tool 2: [Tool].** [1-2 Sentences Explaining Tool].
    
- **Tool 3: [Tool].** [1-2 Sentences Explaining Tool].
    
- **Tool 4: [Tool].** [1-2 Sentences Explaining Tool].
    
- **Tool 5: [Tool].** [1-2 Sentences Explaining Tool].
    

Hope this helps!
