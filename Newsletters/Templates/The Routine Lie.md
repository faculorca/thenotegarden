The biggest lie society tells about daily routines:

(I believed this for *years*)

"[_Lie_]"

But if you fix these [_X_] faulty beliefs, you can become [_Outcome_] as a [_Role_]:

1. [_Faulty Belief 1_]

[_1-liner Explaining Faulty Belief And Outcome Of Fixing It_]

2. [_Faulty Belief 2_]

The secret to the perfect routine isn't:

• [_Common Belief 1_]

• [_Common Belief 2_]

• [_Common Belief 3_]

It's [_Uncommon Belief_].

Thank me later.

3. [_Faulty Belief 3_]

[_1-liner Explaining Faulty Belief And Outcome Of Fixing It_]

I overcome [_Lie_] by fixing these faulty beliefs about my routine.

Hope this helps.
