 p3 | death the default for startups, and most town don’t save them. Is not that some place are startup killers. It’s best to think that all startups are al poisoned and there’s a few places who being sprayed with the antidote.

environment p3 | In most places, if you start a startup, you are seemed as unemployed. This doesn’t happen in startup hubs.

environment p4 | Having people around you care about what you’re doing is a powerful force.

environment p5 | As long as you’re a point of your life where you can bear the risk of failure, the best way to find out if you’re suited to run a startup is to try it.

chance p1 | The second component of the antidote is chance meeting with people who can help you.

chance p4 | if you’re in a startup hub, unexpected good things will probably happen to you, specially if you deserve them.

chance p6 | Chance meetings play a role like the role relaxation plays in having ideas. 
*This reminded me of the Zeigarnick Effect, that is the psychological explaining the reason behind solving problems in the shower or in a dream. Unfinished tasks are better retained by the subconscious than finished tasks.*

chance p8 | The antidote for startup poison is people. Not the physical infrastructure, the weather or anything like that.

chance p9 | Startups tend to help each other without expecting a hand back. Maybe because startups are less of a zero sum game than most types of business; they are rarely killed by competitors. Or maybe because a lot of founders has background in sciences, where collaboration is encouraged.
*Here I noted that startups are a positive sum game, which re the best games to play. Naval compared wealth and status from this lens. Status being a zero-sum game and wealth being a positive-sum game. This signals that a startup goal is to build wealth and not status. Which at the same time is aligned with the perception the world have of startup founders being “unemployed” and “coping”.*

numbers p1 | To make a startup hub you need a *lot* of people interested in startups.
*Here I added a note about the difficulty of attracting talent and founders into this place. Patagonia Biotech Hub (PBH) is a project here in Chile where they are stablishing Puerto Montt - Puerto Varas as a biotech hub for LatAm. One of the problems they have is the escape of the talents. People of Puerto Varas who are going into biotech have to go to college in other cities. How can you bring back that talent into the original place.*

numbers p3 | The bigger the community, the greater the chance it will contain the person will has that one thing you need the most.

numbers p4 | The third reason you need a lot of people to maje a startup hub is that once you have enough people interested in the same problem, they start to set the social norms. And it is a particularly valuable thing when the atmosphere around you encourages you to do something that would otherwise seem too ambitious.
*Here I noted that to this day, the atmoshphere plays a huge role. And ambitious people chase ambitious atmospheres. Even if it’s digital*.
