# The Only Job Security Left: Learn Faster Than Your Industry Changes

GPT-3 launched March 2020. It’s October 2025. Everything changed in 4 years. That’s how long a degree takes. You see the problem, right?

The old model doesn’t work anymore:

_Go to university for 4 years, get your degree and work as a professional for 30 years._

Industries change FAST. Innovation cycles are no longer decades, they’re three or four years.

Four years ago, Claude, Grok, Perplexity and Gemini (or Bard) weren’t even a thing.

Now look at where we are now. AI is positioned as the future, or as a bubble. And the way we do work is completely different. Old jobs are vanishing and new jobs emerging.

The world is changing at light-speed, why would you stay the same?

If you do stay the same, you will be replaced.

Reinvention is a necessity.

### The New Reality

It’s much more important today to be able to become an expert in a brand-new field in nine to twelve months than to have studied the “right” thing a long time ago.

—Naval Ravikant

Innovation cycles run on 3-4 years. University degrees take 4 years (minimum).

By the time you graduate, the field has already changed.

But here’s something interesting: becoming above average in almost anything takes less than a year of deep focus. Not a decade. Not four years.

_Nine to twelve months._

And, in words of Naval, “within those three productive years of mastering a new skill, you can get very wealthy.”

### How to Avoid Being Replaced: Learn Fast

The best jobs are neither decreed nor degreed. They are creative expressions of continuous learners in free markets.

—Naval Ravikant

So what does this mean to you?

You can learn anything in 9-12 months of focused learning. Anything.

You probably won’t become an expert and the top 1% on the field, but you can scale the ladder up to the top 20% pretty quickly.

Without wasting 4 years and thousands of dollars into a traditional degree.

Do I think university is useless? Absolutely not.

But the degree, the certificate itself is useless. It means nothing. Soichiro Honda described it as:

> _“Worth less than a movie ticket. With the ticket, you can at least enter the movie house and spend an enjoyable evening; but a diploma is by no means a sure ticket to life. I don’t give a damn for the diploma. What I want is the knowledge.”_

University forces you to learn quickly, to perform under pressure and to become a better thinker. It also gives you the resources to optimize your learning curve and get the know-hows of the field. But if you already are an avid thinker and learner, a person who puts hands on problems (and you’re not in a regulated profession like health or law), you may want to think it twice.

I have a few examples of _extreme learners_ that could inspire you.

- Elon Musk
    
- Chung Ju-yung (founder of Hyundai)
    
- Charlie Munger
    

### Elon Musk

Elon has a bachelor’s degree in physics and economics, and when he decided to start SpaceX, he had no experience or knowledge in rocket science. Whenever anyone asks him how he learned to build space-traveling rockets, his answer always is: “I read books.”

When aerospace consultant Jim Cantrell first met Musk, Musk had been borrowing all of Cantrell’s college textbooks on rocketry and propulsion. In total, it took Elon Musk two years to learn what he needed to know about rockets.

> _“He was the quickest learner I’ve ever come across. You had this guy who knew everything from a business point of view, but who was also clearly capable of knowing everything from a technical point of view”._
> 
> _— An employee_

He learned rocket science to a point he could say ““I know my rocket inside out and backward. I can tell you the heat treating temper of the skin material, where it changes, why we chose that material, the welding technique… down to the gnat’s ass.”

SpaceX is now valued in four hundred billion dollars.

### Chung Ju-yung

Chung Ju-yung was born in 1915 into an impoverished family in Korea. He initially aspired to become a school teacher, but his family could not afford to support his education. His academic progress stopped at the sixth grade.

Chung grew up so poor he had to eat tree bark and grass roots to survive.

At age 16, Chung ran away from home to seek opportunity in Seoul, making multiple attempts as his father repeatedly tracked him down and brought him back. His persistence paid off. He found work as a dock laborer and then as a rice delivery boy at a local store.

He was happy when the paid went up from 1 bag of rice a month to 20 bags of rice a month.

By 1938, at 24 years old, together with regular customers from his former employer, he opened the Kyungil Rice Store. Being that young, he wanted to build the biggest rice store in Korea. And his store prospered—it did not seem so unreasonable to say that he could achieve it. But in December 1939, all Korean rice stores were forced to close under the new rice distribution policy of the Japanese Government-General.

He lost everything. Again.

So, he pivoted to an auto repair business. The business was going good and he applied everything he learned before into this new venture. But just twenty days after opening, the factory caught on fire.

The whole building burnt down, and five trucks under repair he had to be responsible and pay for.

After World War II, Chung founded a construction company called Hyundai in 1947 with just $5,000. The Korean War soon devastated the peninsula, but Chung recognized opportunity in reconstruction. Chung entered the shipbuilding business with no experience and went on to create the world’s largest shipyard.

> _“I did not receive much schooling. But not receiving formal education does not mean one is lacking in wisdom. It is a mistake to think that broad and deep knowledge can only be obtained through formal schooling”._
> 
> _— Chung Ju-yung_

When told by experts that Korea couldn’t build competitive ships, Chung said, “We’ll learn. The Koreans have good hands.”

And he built Hyundai Heavy Industries into the world’s largest shipbuilder within a decade.

The first 100% Hyundai car was built in 1975.

At its peak, Hyundai Group represented approximately 20% of South Korea’s GDP . Chung became the richest person in Korea.

> _Even though my education stopped after the sixth grade, I’ve always enjoyed reading great books. If my first mentors were my parents, then my second mentors were books._

### Charlie Munger

](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OGju!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00922d39-2ec1-4b43-832e-64e1f0d13a44_428x582.png)

Charlie Munger was Warren Buffett’s mentor and partner. They built Berkshire Hathaway into one of the world’s largest companies, and they are the most famous and well known investors.

Munger graduated from Harvard Law School with magna cum laude and worked as a lawyer. But he reinvented himself, quitting his legal career and taking up investing.

> _I have to say, it isn’t an easy thing to work very hard for many years to build up a significant career, as I had done, and then to destroy that career on purpose_
> 
> _— Charlie Munger_

How was he able to do it? Obsessive reading and continuous learning.

> _“In my whole life, I have known no wise people (over a broad subject matter area) who didn’t read all the time – none, zero”_
> 
> _— Charlie Munger_

Munger, in his own estimations, used to read 500 pages per day across multiple disciplines. Science, psychology, philosophy and economics. That’s how he built his “latticework of mental models” to tackle hard problems. This deserves a whole other post.

By going against the grain of American culture, with a sitting, reading and thinking approach to business, Munger and Buffett were able to become one of the richest men in the whole world and live the life they wanted to live.

Munger died at age 99.

“Develop into a lifelong self-learner through voracious reading; cultivate curiosity and strive to become a little wiser every day”

— Charlie Munger

### Continuous Learners in Free Markets

The old model is dead: four years in university, thirty years in the same career.

That world moved slowly. Innovation took decades and skills stayed relevant for a lifetime.

Love it or hate it, we don’t live in that world anymore.

Today, cycles of innovation happen in three to four years. The skills that matter now might be obsolete by the time a college freshman graduates. AI reshapes entire industries while students are still deciding their majors.

You have two choices: cling to credentials from the past, or become a relentless learner.

Musk went from physics graduate to rocket scientist in two years through books. Chung built a global empire with a sixth-grade education and tree bark in his stomach. Munger destroyed a successful legal career at its peak to reinvent himself as an investor.

None of them succeeded because of their degrees. They succeeded because they never stopped learning.

The best jobs are neither decreed nor degreed. They are creative expressions of continuous learners in free markets.

— Naval Ravikant

The question isn’t what degree you have, it’s what you’re learning right now and what you’re going to do with it.

Start today.

### Jensen Huang
Jensen, founder of NVIDIA, is the longest-serving CEO of Silicon Valley.

He has a Master's in Electrical Engineering from Stanford with a focus on advanced computer architecture, parallel computing, and semiconductor physics.

Yes, the degree was needed to learn the technical part, but that’s not what made NVIDIA what it is today. He could’ve continued on his career working on AMD or similar companies, but started his own.

Huang is a perpetual learner. He learn from his employees every day by a strategy called the “top five emails”, a strategy to learn directly from everyone involved in his company. This is a piece extracted from *The Nvidia Way*:

> [!QUOTE]
> “In most companies, as they grow, managers create status reports, and those reports are cleaned up by layers of management to remove anything negative. By the time the CEO sees it, the report is often useless and doesn’t help steer the company,”
> […]
> Every week or two, every employee writes an email to their team, manager, and various distribution lists that Jensen can access. These emails outline the top five things they’re working on or the top five things they’ve observed in their sector. It could be a major competitor’s move, a new technology, or a cool AI paper.
> […]
> Jensen reads hundreds of these emails every day, this gives him the pulse of what’s happening across the company. No one can hide whether things are going well or poorly.

NVIDA is valued in 4.53 trillion dollars.
