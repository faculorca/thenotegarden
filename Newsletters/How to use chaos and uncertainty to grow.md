# How to use chaos and uncertainty to grow
*key words: Nassim Taleb, Growth, Resilience, Anti-Fragility, Growth-Mindset*

I've always heard people highlighting the importance of being robust or resilient, but hardly ever of being antifragile.

And no, I'm not talking about the song (bummer, I know).

Resilience is the ability to return to base when things go backwards, like water. Robustness is how much something or someone is able to take before things go backwards, like a shield.

Now imagine an object that has little robustness and resilience, something like glass, for example. Something fragile. As soon as something hit this glass, it's going to break and never recover. It has no robustness to endure the stress nor resilience to recover from it. It's a completely fragile system.

## **Antifragility**

An antifragile system is able to grow from chaos. Not only returning back to base, but getting better after it, benefiting from the stress, chaos and volatility of a situation. We see this kind of systems all of the time in stories, the main character who goes trough hardship just to getting better and stronger from it. It's the nature of stories and the human condition. Adapting, surviving and thriving.

Nassim Taleb introduced the concept of antifragility through [his books](https://www.amazon.com/Incerto-Fooled-Randomness-Procrustes-Antifragile/dp/059324365X?s=books). He used mathematics, economics and physics to define and support the argument summarized in his [letter to Nature](https://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/nature-definition.pdf):

> Anti-fragility is a convex response to a stressor or source of harm, leading to a positive sensitivity to volatility (variability, stress or uncertainty). Likewise, fragility is defined as a concave sensitivity to stressors, leading to an increase in volatility.

Anti-fragile systems are everywhere, from mathematics, economics, molecular biology or business. These are some examples I love:

- **The Executive and The Taxi Driver**: A highly paid executive with an expensive lifestyle and debts is way more fragile to a crash in the market and unemployment than a self-employed taxi-driver with no debts, whose a crisis won't hurt him that much.
- **Your Body**: When you train your body, you are tearing up muscle, breaking muscular fibers, just for them to recover bigger and stronger. When you go for a run, your demand of oxygen is higher than usual, for beginners this often leads to a blood taste on the mouth, but your lungs will eventually get better at working at higher oxygen demands, and that taste will stop appearing.
- **Growth Mindset**: The belief that abilities can be developed though effort rather than being fixed traits. You can improve performance by shifting the focus from identity-based labels to effort-based processes. Combined with an antifragile mindset creates a synergistic effect that improve learning and performance in any domain.

If you want to become an antifragile person and be a part of antifragile systems, you have to put "skin in the game". As Nassim Taleb later expanded in a book titled "Skin In The Game", this mindset is thinking that every captain goes down with their ship.

> To me, every opinion maker needs to have "skin in the game" in the event of harm caused by reliance on his information or opinion. Further, anyone producing a forecast or making an economic analysis needs to have something to lose from it, given that others rely on those forecasts (to repeat, forecasts induce risk taking; they are more toxic to us than any other form of human pollution).

## **Becoming Antifragile**

### #1 Via Negativa

Instead of always trying to add habits or activities, focus first on removing things that weaken mental resilience.

- Bad habits
- Social media
- Toxic relationship
- Morning newspaper
- Unnecessary commitments
- News about the stock market

This “subtracting” reduces downside risks and builds a stronger foundation for growth.

**_Actionable Steps:_**

- Unsubscribe from sources of negative/distracting media
- Say "no" to commitments that don't align with your core goals
- End or limit relationships that consistently leaves you drained (it can be your phone too)

### #2 Barbell Strategy

Combine **playing it safe in core areas while taking many small, controlled risks elsewhere**.

This approach lets you benefit from “upside volatility” without risking total loss. Improving antifragility by experimenting and learning from small failures.

![[How to use chaos and uncertainty to grow-1.png]]

**_Actionable Steps:_**

- Identify your "safe core" - the 20% of activities that provide 80% of your security
- List 3 small, low-cost experiments you could try (new skills, side projects, networking)
- Start ONE small experiment with maximum $50 or 5-hour investment

### #3 Redundant Systems

Why are Japanese cars well-known for? Reliability.

The best way to be reliable is having a plan B, a plan C, and D. That is redundancy, if something fails, it isn't really a problem, you have other things that cover the failure so the system keeps working.

A way to apply this is creating mental “backup plans” and diversify your skills, interests, and social networks. Having multiple pathways or options helps you thrive in disorder because you can pivot instead of breaking under pressure.

And speaking of Japanese cars, it's always is a great moment to re-read the iconic [1999 Toyota Corolla Craigslist ad.](https://www.boredpanda.com/1999-toyota-corolla-creative-funny-advertisement/)

![[How to use chaos and uncertainty to grow-2.png]]

**_Actionable Steps:_**

- Map your current "single points of failure" (income source, key relationships, skills)
- Identify 3 alternative paths for your biggest vulnerability
- Take one concrete step toward building a backup option

(If you are interested in affronting fears and building redundant systems in your life, you can read [this Tim Ferriss blog post about Fear-Setting](https://tim.blog/2017/05/15/fear-setting/))

### #4 Voluntary Discomfort

Regularly challenge yourself with difficult cognitive tasks, physical challenges, or uncomfortable conversations. This strengthens neural connections and promotes neuroplasticity. More brain resilience and endurance to hardship.

For this you can:

- Read books just above your level
- Do cold showers/plunges
- Do something you hate but it's beneficial (for me, that's going for a run)
- Confront difficult matters immediately, the sooner you tackle difficult conversations, the better.

**_Actionable Steps:_**

- Identify one thing you avoid because it's uncomfortable (difficult conversation, hard task, physical challenge)
- Do that thing within 48 hours
- Set a small daily challenge that pushes you out of your comfort zone

### #5 Focusing On Long Term

Don't optimize only for immediate reward or comfort.

Antifragility grows from playing the long game, accepting short-term setbacks or losses in exchange for stronger and more adaptive mental capacities over time.

That's the delayed gratification everyone talks about.

**_Actionable Steps:_**

- Identify 3 areas where you're optimizing for immediate comfort vs. long-term gains
- Choose one area to accept short-term inefficiency for long-term benefit
- Start one practice that pays off in months/years, not days

Becoming antifragile is not a perfect route to a destination. Is about experimentation and iteration. If during your voluntary discomfort practice you realize cold showers aren't working for you, pivot to some other thing instead.

If your barbell strategy feels too conservative, adjust the balance between safety and experimentation. The five principles: via negativa, barbell strategy, redundant systems, voluntary discomfort, and long-term thinking, work together as a flexible framework, not rigid rules.

This antifragile approach to personal development will change how you view challenges, transforming obstacles into opportunities for growth. You'll develop a collection of stress-tested strategies that have been proven in the chaos of your own life.

On the other hand, by putting skin in the game by actually implementing these ideas rather than just consuming them, you become someone who is much more capable to move through uncertainty.

Remember: fragile systems break under pressure, robust systems resist it, resilient systems recover from it—but antifragile systems get better because of it.

Chaos will come to your life, the question is if you'll be ready to benefit from it when it does.

Thank you for reading,
