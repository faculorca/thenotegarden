# Note Systems 101- A Crash Course On Everything You Need To Know

People make note systems way too complicated.

Here's what you need to know (ignore everything else):

## Zettelkasten Myths & Mistakes

First, unlearn this myths:

- **Is a tool for remembering everything** - "you will never forget anything again!!!!". BS.
- **Is storage of cool ideas** - “Clip it, tag it, link it, to the next thing”. Uhmm, okay, but when do you *learn*.
- **Second Brains don’t exist** - The common belief that we build a system as capable as our brain is a waste of time. First, our brains are designed to forget, they are not solid storage. Second, hyperlinks are not a replacement for reflection.

Now, where are note systems going?

## Trends & Data In Note Systems

Here are 3 important trends to keep in mind:

- **Trend #1**: Hybrid digital-analog systems are emerging. 

People are blending digital efficiency with analog simplicity. Mixing both ends up with a simple and flexible system that none can offer by itself. 

- **Trend #2 :** Simple note systems with *Getting Things Done* mentality are the future. 

So many people dropped their own note systems because it got too complex and more of a burden than a thinking tool.

- **Trend #3**: Emphasis for privacy and human thinking. 

People are getting sick of AI integrations everywhere, personal data used to train models and outsourcing thinking. There’s a growing movement that enhances thinking and privacy through systems (without benching AI)

Those are the stakes, how can you get started?

## Actionable Tips To Building An Effective Note-System

Here's how I would get started:

- Step 1: Set up a smooth way of capturing ideas of your own and others. Integrate clipping plugins into your note system. Plugins like *Send to Notion*, *Obsidian Clipper*, or *Readwise* (which I recommend the most) will do the trick.
- Step 2: Process the captures. Having a collection of ideas saved in your files is worth nothing. Start creating trains of thought of ideas and save them each in one separate file. Link them using “next”, “previous”, “see” (give context on the connection on the last one).
- Step 3: Write for readers. Pull one idea and pull the thread, connecting multiple ideas in one piece that you can share with the world.
- Bonus: Practice non-attachment to your captures. Be ready to send to trash a big chunk of captures, because that will happen, and it’s fine. Don’t keep them there just because it may come in handy, there will be another idea that will be even better.

That's it!

Ignore the rest of the noise around notes. This is all you need to know to take the first step to building an effective note-system.

PS - If you want to build your system, hit me a DM and I will gladly help you to set it up :)
