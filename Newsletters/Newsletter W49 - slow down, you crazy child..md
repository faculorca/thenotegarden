*tbh, this is freestyled. No template or anything.*

This year has been sick. Everything went by so fucking fast and so fucking slow at the same time. Pictures that are a few months old feel like an eternity ago. And still I can't believe the year is ending.

I've been running. Maybe not in my actions all the time. But surely in my head.

Always in a rush to get to a better place. To get closer to this successful life I convinced myself I want to live. Every day counts. Every hour counts. Every *second* counts.

And everything goes backwards. Your haste can't fit into reality, more so if you always think you can do things better and faster. And you run and don't stop. There's a place to get to.

One step after another, the focus always on the next couple meters, because you have to get there fast.

And never stopping to see where you are now, because you are not where you want to be yet.

So you miss the pink light of the sunset hitting the clouds in that specific way, and you miss the trees on your way home, and you miss your pets trying to get your attention, and you miss calling your friends and hanging out with them, and you miss calling your mom, and you miss... your life.

Because you're too focused on the few next steps. Always.

Every time you petted your pets, you hugged your loved ones, you spend time on your hobbys or with your friends was in some kind of a rush, always thinking about the next.

Never stopping to appreciate where you are now. The warmth of the present that will never come back. A present that as soon as you think about it, it's already a memory.

Time moves on and it seems we are generating less and less memories. It seems like everything is so timely, and yet we are convinced that wasting our time is about not focusing on the next steps. Maybe not wasting time is just being present and intentional.

But what do I know. For years I've struggled with this. I try to get myself to places and reach my goals. I put a lot of effort into becoming someone I'm proud of. But when things don't work as fast as I want them to work. When things go backwards. I can't sleep, I eat worse, I feel tired, training stops recharging me, and the things I love doing starts to feel like a burden. So I just disconnect my brain and... scroll.

I've never shared how much it hurts to be in a moment and know you are not as present as you would like to be. Knowing you're not enjoying something as much as you could, and the only reason is being stuck on your own head.

You've probably felt that too.

And let me tell you, as long as you keep trying to live more present in your own life, and put effort onto it, things are going to get better.

Or that is what I want to convince myself to do.

This text is a ramble that I feel it has some great connection potential. It's personal, and it honestly scares me a bit to put it out there, but I hope this will help someone not feel alone.

Sorry for the nonsense, I am barely making sense of myself.
