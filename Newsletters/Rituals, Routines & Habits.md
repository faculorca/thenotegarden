# Rituals, Routines & Habits

Wake up, take a shower, grab a cup of coffee, start your day.

That's how most people start their days (me included).

This steps are so ingrained that we do it automatically.

But often times we auto-pilot more and more of our decisions as a way of offloading cognitive resources to save mental energy. Nobody think about it that way though, but we all still:

- Shake our legs when anxious.
- Brush our teeth automatically before bed.
- Unlock our phones when there's nothing new to see.

This things that we do on auto-pilot are habits.

I've been so fed up by this niche of productivity and self-development that habits were always something to make (the good ones) or break (the bad ones).

Always titles like "_8 Habits That (quickly) Change Your Life_" or "_The One Habit That Is Changing My Life_". And I'm not hating on them, they're playing the game of attention, and often they have interesting things to share. Habits, indeed, are something to make or break.

But there's something we are not seeing in all of this _trying-to-get-better-at-life_ thing, the siblings of habits that get pushed to the side: **_Routines and Rituals._**

The three of them are practices we do repeatedly with a goal. The main difference is intention.

**Habits** are the foundation of them all, the ones with the least amount of intention in them. We do them because well… we do.

They're auto-pilot, we dress in a certain way, we walk through the same places and we appear in pictures in the same way. Why? I don't know, it's what we just do, right?

But what about the routes you take every day, making a coffee and some toast at breakfast or going to the gym every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

**Routines** require deliberate practice.

Going to the gym, journaling, going for a walk, drinking enough water, meditating and writing are all practices that you need to be conscious about repeating or they will die out. It never happened to me that I get in auto-pilot and walk to the gym for a heavy session.

Both habits and rituals are regular actions.

Habits are auto-pilot and routines are not.

You can turn routines into habits if you put enough reps to create a loop.

- **Trigger your brain into a routine**—have lunch and go for a walk immediately.
- **Execute the routine**—it's good to start small. Progressive overload for you gymrats.
- **Reward your brain for the routine**—tell your brain this routine is a good thing by rewarding it with something enjoyable.

This way you'll turn healthy routines into habits, it's just a matter of time, and repeating the loop.

But what if you want to break the loop. Be more intentional with the routine.

### Turning Routines into Rituals

When you hear about rituals is normal to think about religious practices, because they are. And if you have them, leverage them, you don't need to build them from the ground up.

But if you, as me, don't have any religious rituals (or if you want turn any activity into a ritual) here's what you can do.

First of all, **rituals do not have to be religious, or even spiritual**. They need to have special intention behind. Change the lens from "executing the routine" to "living the experience of the routine".

I'm sure you've had this moment where you were walking the same streets as always and the city felt prettier than everyday, this walk when the cloud were beautiful and the breeze was at the right temperature, or even that hot shower that felt particularly comforting after a long week.

**_You can turn every routine into a more mindful moment._**

And that's what I want to stay with you for now.

### Living Intentionally

A friend of mine one day told me the she wishes she could be more mindful and staying more on the _now,_ but she couldn't make time to meditate, or yoga or journaling consistently.

The thing is, you don't need them all to start being more mindful. You can add layers of consciousness into your daily life, making the showers more relaxing, making work less stressing and foods more enjoyable.

So, you can add up intentionality to your routines to make them rituals, or remove intentionality to turn them habits.

It's on you which routines go where.

Thank you for reading,
