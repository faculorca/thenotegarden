# NL25W40 Welcome to The Note Garden

When I was 16, I first tried to build my own “second brain”.

I was in high-school, and I loved studying topics outside of the curriculum. I had so many ideas I couldn’t deal with them all. This second brain was supposed to become my most useful and long-standing tool. It was supposed to become the way I could remember everything.

So, every idea went to my Obsidian. Incomplete notes, hyper-connected with everything, a beautiful graph waiting to become a copy of my neuron, I was so hyped.

But none of that came. Instead, it became a mausoleum. A dusted collection of notes piled up in a way I couldn’t even understand or use.

## **Instead of aiding my memory, it froze my curiosity.**

After some time of tinkering with the software and turning it into a complex and interesting system, the thing that I feared happened. Sitting to work on ideas turned into a chore. I was stuck looking at a blank screen without knowing what to write about and how to connect that idea into this mess I made.

So I dropped it… for a while.

I came back to it and tried again. Instead of using Obsidian, now it’s the turn of Notion. I followed infinite tutorial, downloaded templates to help me set up the perfect system, and then… the same thing happened again.

And I stopped trying for a while. 

In college I just took notes on traditional notebooks or digital notes with the mindset of 90% of students: trying to write as much as I can from what the professor says. Then I would just add the course material into the mix. Yes, I hyperlinked here and there (the Obsidian graph turned out to be pretty), but not with a solid system of idea connection. Today I don’t remember a thing I wrote back then.

But I’m not a person who gives up quickly on things I care about, so I tried again. And failed. And tried. And failed. And tried… You get the point.

Now I’m 23, I’ve been writing notes and learning obsessively about the topics I really like for a while. But most importantly, now I know what is important to me and have my own opinions on life. So I’ve been writing online for the last 12 months. Writing a lot. And trying new ways, strategies and frameworks to write better.

So, a few days ago, I stepped into yet another Obsidian video, this one from a Creator I respect a lot. So I put aside my messy notes and pressed play. At the end of the video, this guy recommended two books, and one of them I had never read or seen before: *A System for Writing*, by Bob Doto.

**I started reading, and everything clicked.**

The abandoned notes, the unpublished newsletters, the clunky systems, everything fell into place. 

Now I know why I failed so much.

I started realizing why second brain systems are a lie. A useful lie that has allowed people to start their writing journey, I’m not denying that, but a lie still.  It promises order, clarity and productivity, but delivers abstracted confusion. 

Clip it, tag it, link it and move on. Like vacuum sealed food never to be eaten.

![[Sealed food.png|An absurd representation of my previous tries at Second Brain]]

Even the metaphor of a second brain is biologically absurd. Human memory is not an archive. We do not think in folders. Our memory is associative, contextual and emotional. Your brain is designed to forget, so let’s not fight it.

## Nobody really wants a “second brain”, what people want is a Mental Workbench for the brain to tinker with ideas.

Now I have an adaptable system that help me write instead of taking my time from it. Instead of collecting everything I see on the internet, I am able to highlight and note what matter and process everything in one place that is easy to organize and move in.

That is why I changed my newsletter this week. I want to help you reach the same. Build a system of your own, with just enough tools to make it efficient, but not enough for it to make it overwhelming.

Because I truly believe that you don’t need a second brain if you can trust the one you already have.

That’s why I built the Note Garden, so you can build a system of your own.

# Short-form
## Story (A full-blown story)
### **Pain/Attention**
{{use a personal story or start with a problem}}
### **Agitate**
{{share how things got worse and what happened to you/someone}}
### **Intrigue**
{{show them a new perspective to think about that’s intriguing}}
### **Positive Future**
{{show the future benefits associated with the intrigue}}
### **Solution**
{{bring clarity to how they can achieve a positive future with a solution}}
## Observation
What’s something interesting you noticed?

Second Brain systems are a lie.

A useful lie that has allowed people to start their writing journey, I’m not denying that, but a lie still.

It promises order, clarity and productivity, but delivers abstracted confusion. 

Clip it, tag it, link it and move on. Like vacuum sealed food never to be eaten.
```
## Contrarian
What’s a commonly held belief about this that’s wrong?
[[{{Desired result}} has almost nothing to do with {{common belief}}]]

```
A good writing system has almost nothing to do with perfect notes.
It’s about simplicity.
Then add:

- Captures
- Templatization
- Trains of tought
- Sharing with the world
  
Simplicity + flexibility = writing results
```

## Listicle
What are some tools/books/newsletters/Tweets about this?

```
An easy way to think better is to simply:

- Read more
- Write more
- Share your work
- Get feedback and improve

So many people ignore this very simple thing. Squeaky wheel gets the oil.

This is the start of The Note Garden

After 7+ years of trial and error building writing systems, I finally understood how to make them sustainable.

1. Smooth captures
2. Frictionless processing
3. Connecting them in Hub Content
4. Sharing it with the world

Tomorrow, I'll show 15+ people why to build your Note Garden

Not a “second brain”, but a workbench to tinker with ideas.
