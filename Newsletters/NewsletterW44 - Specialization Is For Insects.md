There are three types of people in the world:

- specialists.
- generalists,
- and polymaths.

You can visualize this using a T-shape. The horizontal line represents the breadth and diversity of your knowledge. The vertical line represents depth.

Specialists have a short horizontal line and a much longer vertical one. They know their field deeply and often create new knowledge within it. But they’re isolated in their niche, unable to see beyond their walls.

Generalists have a much longer horizontal line. Their knowledge is broad, diverse, and—here’s the problem—_**general**_. Surface-level. It’s hard to create meaningful change in the world from superficial understanding alone.

Polymaths combine both. They have diverse knowledge _and_ depth. They can connect ideas across different domains, generate novel insights, and take action on their understanding.

I strongly believe the future belongs to people who can connect the dots.

To polymaths.

## **The Problem With Silo-Thinking**

> “All the wisdom in the world cannot be found in a small academic department.” — Charlie Munger

Schools and society teach us to separate knowledge into silos: biology, economics, history, philosophy, technology. This helps us categorize and specialize.

But your brain doesn’t work in silos. Reality doesn’t work in silos.

In your mind, information is fluid and interconnected. It rarely divides into such closed categories.

Almost all great thinkers are what I call “silo-free thinkers.”

[[10.2b3a All great thinkers are silo-free thinkers]]

They avoid seeing the world through a single lens. They develop what you might call _liquid knowledge_, understanding that flows easily from one topic to another.

These lenses are mental models. And these thinkers are modern polymaths.

## **What Makes Someone a Polymath?**

A polymath knows one area deeply while having expertise across many others. More importantly, they can connect the dots between them.

[[10.2b3c A polymath is able to connect the dots]]

The Renaissance gave us the greatest examples. The concept of the “universal man” emerged from Renaissance humanism, the ideal that humans should develop all their capacities and that knowledge is interconnected.

Modern hyperspecialization didn’t exist yet.

That’s why we had figures like Leonardo da Vinci: painter, sculptor, architect, engineer, anatomist, inventor, mathematician, musician, and writer. The supreme example of a polymath.

Renaissance polymaths mainly generated and connected information. Few things had been discovered using systematic processes. They earned their place in history by inventing things previously unthinkable.

In some ways, Renaissance polymaths had an advantage over us.

But we have an even greater one.

## **The Modern Polymath’s Advantage**

Today, information is everywhere. The things left to discover are highly specialized. So, the modern polymath’s task isn’t to generate information but to take existing information and use it to innovate.

The modern polymath must learn to dig through internet garbage (which represents most of the internet) to find the relevant knowledge nuggets.

The ability to distinguish good from bad, real from false, relevant from superficial comes from critical thinking.

This is why your Note Garden matters. It’s not just collecting information. It’s about processing it, connecting it, and making it _liquid_.

## **Being a Polymath is Not a Destination**

This is important: _being a polymath_ isn’t a destination. It’s a journey.

You need to adopt a mindset of curiosity and experimentation. Accept it as an opportunity to learn, grow, and become a more interesting person. Not for others, for yourself.

As John David McKee wrote:

> “Being a polymath is an active pursuit to expand what you know and connect the dots between different ideas to be a more effective critical thinker, empower yourself to make better decisions, and continuously become a better version of yourself.”

And I couldn’t agree more.

## **The Path Forward**

The polymath path is simple but not easy. You need to develop meta-skills:

- Learn _how to think_
    
- Learn _how to learn quickly and efficiently_
    
- Use both to _think creatively and find new solutions_
    

This is where average learning systems fail you. They optimize for collection, not connection.

Having a place of interconnected notes should facilitate polymathic thinking by:

**Breaking down silos with links.** When you connect a note about evolutionary biology to one about business strategy, you’re thinking like a polymath. You’re finding patterns across domains.

**Atomizing ideas so they’re context-free.** An atomic idea from physics can suddenly illuminate a problem in psychology. But only if you’ve extracted the core principle from its original context.

**Building liquid knowledge.** Your notes shouldn’t sit in rigid folders labeled “Marketing” or “Philosophy.” Tag them. Let them exist in multiple contexts simultaneously. Let unexpected connections emerge.

**Filtering signal from noise.** Not every idea deserves a note. Not every connection matters. Critical thinking means knowing what to keep and what to discard.

## The Modern Renaissance

We’re living through a new renaissance. AI is changing everything. Industries transform in years, not decades. The half-life of knowledge is shrinking.

The old model—go to university for four years, get your degree, work as a professional for 30 years—doesn’t work anymore.

You can’t afford to be a specialist who knows nothing outside their domain. You can’t be a generalist who knows nothing deeply. You need both.

You need to be a polymath.

And the thing is: you _can_ become one. It’s not reserved for geniuses or Renaissance men. It’s a practice. A system.

I’ve made my Note Garden as the tool that makes it possible.

## **Why This Matters**

Polymaths are the people who:

- See patterns others miss
    
- Connect ideas across unrelated fields
    
- Generate innovations at the intersection of domains
    
- Adapt quickly to changing landscapes
    
- Build unique perspectives nobody else has
    

They’re the ones who create startups that disrupt industries by applying principles from completely different fields. The writers who weave together neuroscience, philosophy, and personal experience into compelling narratives. The researchers who solve problems by importing solutions from other disciplines.

The world’s biggest challenges won’t be solved by specialists working in isolation. They’ll be solved by polymaths who can think across boundaries.

## **How to Start**

Don’t try to become Leonardo Da Vinci overnight. That’s not the point.

Start with what you’re curious about. Read widely. Take notes on what resonates. But, please, _connect those notes_. _**Do something with those notes**._

When you write about artificial intelligence, link it to notes on creativity.

When you capture ideas about business strategy, connect them to evolutionary biology.

When you learn about stoic philosophy, tie it to modern psychology.

These connections are where polymathic thinking happens. Not in the collection. In the connection.

Your Note Garden isn’t a “second brain”. It’s a tool for becoming more polymathic. For developing liquid knowledge. For thinking across silos.

Because as Heinlein said: “Specialization is for insects.”

The future belongs to polymaths.

And you can become one.
