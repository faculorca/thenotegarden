# Using Zettelkasten IDs without losing your mind

I’ve been using second brains and PKM systems for +5 years now. In all that time, I thought that IDs in a zettelkasten (folgezettel) were only useful in physical systems. 

You may believe that writing an alphanumeric ID in each note of a digital zettelkasten is useless, if you think about it, why would you do that if you have hyperlinks in almost any software that exists?

That’s what most people get wrong.

Using IDs is a game changer even in a digital environment because of only one reason:

Being able to follow the train of thought.

Before I start, it’s important to know notice that using folgezettels in a digital environment is not necessary, but it is a good practice that you can leverage to level up your note system. 

## How to use folgezettels the right way

Imagine IDs as trackers for trains of thought.

At glance it may be difficult, but it’s not.

The starting point is marked with a 1.1, your first main note. As you write your idea into this note, other ideas will emerge surrounding it, your brain has already made the connection, so you follow it. 

The next note is then marked with a 1.1a.

But what if note 1.1 lead to multiple ideas? Then, each of them is marked with 1.1a, 1.1b, 1.1c and so it goes.

Here’s an example of the first notes I used folgezettel with:

```
1.1 An anti fragile system is able to grow from chaos
1.1a To become anti-fragile, put skin on the game
1.1b A zettelkasten is an antifragile system
	1.1b1 Zettelkastens are build upon the connection between trains of thought
		1.1b1a Following the train of thought is flow inducing
1.1c Anti fragile systems are everywhere
```

or a simpler one given by Bob Doto in his book “*A system for writing*”

```
1.1 Not all apples are considered edible
1.1a Crab apples are often mistaken for cider apples
1.2 There are many different kinds of apples
1.3 Apples are a kind of fruit
1.4 Apples can be an integral part of a healthy diet
2.1 Skateboarding is not a crime
```

Using this folgezettels is really subjective, so the connections and IDs you use may vary depending on the place your mind is at the moment of note-making. (see [[2.1b3 The difference between note making and note taking]])

*Meta example time*
```
As I was writing the previous paragraph, it came to mind the idea that how you use your IDs is not the same every time you are note-making.

But I don't have an explanation in my notes on the difference between note-taking and note-making yet. So I might as well create that note.

Since this note you're reading is 2.1b and I have already created 2.1b1 and 2.1b2, now I will creat 2.1b3, so the train of thought is somthing like this:

2.1b Using zettelkasten IDs without losing your mind
2.1b1 Folgezettel forces you to connect newly imported ideas
2.1b2 Folgezettel is a from of eufriction
2.1b3 The difference between note making and note taking.
```

But, wait a second. This last note don't talk too well to the folgezettel ones, but still is part of this train of thought. What to do now? 

Do I change the ID to connect it to "2.1 The Zettelkasten is a tool for thinking and writing" or do I keep it here?

You keep it.

Now you have a sense of how to use them, so you might as well experiment with them. Put a 1.1 before the title of the next note you write and see what happens from there.

Just remember that
- Folgezettel is not an outline
- Unless you use paper, is not necessary. But you can gain tons from using them.
- Alphanumeric IDs are not a tree structure

Keep attention to impulses of finding the right spots for notes. Keep your thinking at the level of ideas and not structure.

That’s it for now, pretty advanced stuff here, but I hope it was useful.

Thank you for reading, and if you have any question hit me a DM.
