![[NL25W42 - Creator Flywheel.png]]
One of the best things I’ve ever done is writing every day.

Today, I will share with you how to start your own writing flywheel.

I’ve always been one of those people who tend to overthink. Always trapped in tutorial hell, learning and learning without taking action. Writing is the thing that clears my mind and guided me towards action. 

And just as I started writing here, I bet you that every successful creator is a writer. 

Every. Single. One

Unfortunately, most people can’t keep a writing habit for a long time, and the reason is simple.

## They get stuck and never close the loop.

- Capturing everything or nothing, no in between.
- Getting stuck in the blank page.
- Polishing and never publishing.
- Not getting feedback.

But don’t worry, the solution is simpler than you may think.

Here's how, step by step:

### **Step 1: Capture and generate ideas**

Writing is about sharing ideas. But first, you have to capture or generate them.

You can have your own ideas, but sometimes the idea tank is dry. 

Don’t be scared to take others ideas and make it your own. Remember that the human hand is uncapable of perfect copy (Austin Kleon btw).

My system for jotting down ideas is chaotic but more functional than ever. The main principle is keeping it frictionless. I take fleeting notes on my Obsidian, on a physical pocket notebooks with detachable pages, sending messages to myself and recording voice notes in my walks.

A few years ago I was paranoic about losing ideas. I tried to capture it all. But now, I don’t really care. If an idea is lost is because it wasn’t that good after all, archive them or directly delete them.

If it’s good is going to come back.

Practice non-attachment with your ideas, it will set you free.

### **Step 2: Choose an idea, create an outline, limit your time**

Here is when the biggest enemy of the writer appears. Blank page syndrome.

**First, choose an idea.** Of all the ideas you captured and generates, choose one that you resonate with.

**Second, create an outline.** Nothing fancy, just a bulleted list saying:

- What’s the message?
- What’s good/bad about it?
- What’s the change I want in the reader?
- And any other question you find interesting.

**And third, limit your time.** Constraints breed creativity, so put on a timer and start writing. Answer the questions you used for the outline and do it against the clock. Your constraint will be time.

And remember that “work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion”.
### **Step 3: Share what you wrote. Shamelessly.**

Now it’s time to obsessively re-read and edit forever! Jokes, don’t do that.

Re-read once and edit on the fly. One is enough.

Never skip the edit, but don’t overdo it either.

Then… Hit publish.

If you wrote something amazing, set it out to the world.

If it’s not something amazing, set it out to the world.

And share it. Share it. Share it. Share it.

Be proud of what you create, and show everyone you did.

Get the feedback in, take the ideas and ignore the useless comments.

That’s how you start the flywheel of writing.

# Short-form
## Story (A full-blown story)
### **Pain/Attention**
I always wanted to become a creator of some sort.

But I was trapped in tutorial hell for years. 

Learning course after course, consuming content endlessly, but never actually creating anything. 

My mind was foggy, overwhelmed with information but starved for action.
### **Agitate**

I always ended up convincing myself I wasn't ready yet. 

One more course. One more book. One more framework. 

Meanwhile, successful creators were building audiences and businesses by just being out there. 

I kept stuck in analysis paralysis, overthinking every move.

### **Intrigue**

Then I FINALLY realized the obvious: 

the answer wasn't learning MORE. It was writing daily. 

Not perfect writing. Not polished writing. Just writing. 

And it cleared the fog quickly.

### **Positive Future**

Now, writing is my compass. 

Every piece I publish moves me forward. 

I capture ideas without attachment, post not aiming for perfection, and let feedback guide my next move. 

The loop works faster each week, and action replaces overthinking.

### **Solution**

Start your own writing loop: 

- Capture ideas frictionlessly. 
- Create outlines and write against a timer. 
- Edit once and publish shamelessly. 

The loop closes when you share and get feedback. 

That's when the magic happens.

## Observation
What’s something interesting you noticed?
- [x] Buffer
- [ ] Substack
```
Every successful creator I know is a writer first, everything else second.

Whether they 
- make videos, 
- podcasts, 
- or courses, 
  
They all write. 

Writing is the meta-skill that unlocks all other content creation.
```

The best idea capture system is the one that's so frictionless you actually use it.

Fancy note-taking apps die unused. 

- Voice notes on walks, 
- texts to yourself, 
- scraps of paper
  
Simplest ways survive because there's zero friction.
```

```
The ideas that come back are the ones worth keeping.

We're paranoid about losing ideas, but good ideas are persistent. 

They haunt you until you write them down. 

Bad ideas directly disappear and never return.
```

## Contrarian
What’s a commonly held belief about this that’s wrong?

Consistent publishing has almost nothing to do with perfectionism.

People often thing that you need to refine your craft before publishing regularly.

But the truth is that you refine your craft BY publishing regularly. 

The feedback loop is the teacher.

A great writing habit has almost nothing to do with inspiration

Most writers depend on the uncertainty of inspiration.

Prolific writers use constraints, timers and deadlines.

Inspiration is what amateurs wait for.
```

- [x] Buffer
- [ ] Substack
```
Writer's block has almost nothing to do with not having ideas.

You're not stuck because you don't know what to write about.

You're stuck because you haven't chosen ONE idea and created an outline.

Blank page syndrome is a decision problem, not an idea problem.

6 Tools as Writing Stack

1. Obsidian - The backbone of my writing 
2. Pocket notebook - Quick capture 
3. @EchoAINotes - Thoughts during walks 
4. Timer - Putting time constraints 
5. Substack - Long-form publishing 
6. Twitter - Short-form and idea validation

5 Austin Kleon Principles That Changed My Writing

1. Make something every day
2. Practice non-attachment
3. "Steal like an artist"
4. Keep a swipe file
5. Show your work

Why Most Writers Quit Before the Flywheel Starts

They get stuck at different points in the loop and never close it:

- The Hoarders capture everything obsessively but never choose what to develop. Their note apps are graveyards of half-baked ideas.
  
- The Perfectionists write but never publish. They edit draft seventeen while others have shipped and learned from fifty published pieces.
  
- The Broadcasters publish but never share. They hit "post" and close the laptop, wondering why nobody reads their work. No sharing = no feedback = no flywheel.

The cycle only works when you complete all three steps: 

Capture → Write → Share. 

Break the loop anywhere and the flywheel stops spinning. Keep it closed and momentum compounds.

Most writers quit before they ever gain momentum 

Here's why: 

1. Stare at blank pages 
2. They polish endlessly 
3. They publish but never share (so no feedback loop closes) 
   
Tomorrow, I'll show how to fix them with a writing loop

Yesterday, I shared how to build a writing habit that sticks.

No more tutorial hell.
No more polishing forever.
No more blank page syndrome.

Yesterday, the subs learned how to close the loop and start their writing flywheel
