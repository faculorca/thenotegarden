A friend asked me to teach him Obsidian. After seven years of using and testing every major note-taking app, here's what I'd tell anyone starting from scratch.

This guide teaches you everything I wish I knew when I first installed Obsidian in high school. You'll learn to create notes that actually last, connect ideas, and build a system that grows with you without wasting time cleaning folders.

Whether you're a D&D dungeon master planning campaigns, a student managing research, or a writer organizing ideas, you'll master the fundamentals that make Obsidian the most powerful note-taking app available.

Obsidian is just better. It stores everything as plain markdown files (plain text with simple formatting like bold and headers) on YOUR computer instead of a company's database. This means your notes can outlive the app itself. Even if Obsidian disappears tomorrow, you still have readable text files. This "files over app" philosophy is why I keep going back to Obsidian. (And it's way faster too).

**What you'll learn:**
1. Setting up your first vault
2. The 3 principles of future-proof notes
3. Using properties and templates to scale without folders

## Before you start, here's how to move quick in the app

The first thing you have to do is [download](https://obsidian.md/download) the app for your device and set up your "vault" (the way Obsidian calls the folder in which your workspace is). Pick a vault name and a place to save it in your computer.

If you want to have your files saved on the cloud, you can set the vault location inside of your cloud folder on your device. It will back up every file and you don't have to pay anyone. Or you can use Obsidian Sync and support the developers.

Once created, this is what you'll see:

![[Obsidian Welcome Menu.png]]

Here are the shortcuts I use the most, and the only ones you'd need at the beginning:

```
# → Headline 1
## → Headline 2
### → Headline 3
#### → Headline 4

Ctrl + P → Open the Command Palette (Obsidian's search bar for every function)
Ctrl + B → Bold
Ctrl + I → Italics
Ctrl + K → Hyperlink

[[]] → A link between notes

--- → Horizontal line
```

BONUS: Some keyboard tips to go faster while writing:

```
# Using the arrow keys
Ctrl + ← → = To move between words and not characters
Shift + ← → = Select a character left or right
Ctrl + Shift + ← → = Select whole words left or right

Shift + Home = Select the whole line from end to beginning
Shift + End = Select the whole line from beginning to end
```

Now that you have the bare bones on how to navigate efficiently, let's learn how to use it effectively
## Write future-proof notes

Keep in mind this system is how I take notes, and my adaptation of a Zettelkasten, a German note-taking method where each note contains one idea and links to related concepts. I've simplified it: no numbering system, no strict citation format. Just atomic notes with contextual links.

Take what's useful to you and ignore the rest. The goal is to have a workspace that works for you, so it will take time and iterations. 

Anyway, this is my must-have in a sustainable workspace:

1. Notes should be one contained idea. No extra context.
2. Notes should have clear and declarative names.
3. Notes should be densely linked.

### 1. Notes should be one contained idea.

Picture this: You write "Writing Tips" with 15 ideas crammed in. Six months later, you need that insight about daily practice for another article, but it's buried under paragraphs about grammar and outlining techniques. You waste 10 minutes searching or give up.

With atomic notes, you create 'Writing every day builds discipline' and find it instantly. One search, one result, zero wasted time.

***Important disclaimer**: You can write long notes or files. I often do that and then separate the ideas inside of them into smaller isolated notes. This way I'm also able to leverage the flow in writing an article in one sitting, but having the individual notes afterwards.*

So, let's create our first note using `Ctrl + N`.

We can say, for example: 

`Obsidian is a great place to make notes`

You've created your first note. Now let's keep writing.

`Obsidian is better than Notion, Roam Research and almost every other app because it is developed on the principle of "files over app"`

![[First Note Example.png]]

We are used to traditional writing and note-taking. We pick a topic and **write extensively**, connecting ideas in a linear way. This exercise is good for free-hand writing, but unsustainable when you grow your vault.

So, instead, write notes around one idea and one idea only.

![[Note Example.png]]

As you might see, this note is about the idea I declare in the title of it.

I avoided adding "how to build a writing habit", "writing is an outlet of creativity", or anything else. This note is all about the relationship between a sustainable writing habit and MY experience with it.

And this leads us to the next point: **naming notes.**

### 2. Notes should have simple, clear and declarative names

I used to name notes with abstract concepts and topics. "Writing is good", "Trains of thought" or "Lifestyle business."

As a rule of thumb, naming notes like this is not useful:

- {topic}
- {character}
- {object}
- {people}
- {concept}

Those are abstract and they could work better as tags, instead of note titles

Instead, go for declarative naming that shows your opinion, a fact or a statement.

- {topic} is more complex than {other topic}
- {character} would never do {action}
- {object} is useless for {niche}
- {people} is obsessed with {action}
- {concept} should be {characteristic}

These are some of my notes.

 - SM58 and Samson Q8 are the gold standard of microphones
 - Complex systems are the evolution of simple systems
 - Humans should develop all their capacities

Look at your last note title. Could it work as a sentence in an essay? If not, it's probably too vague.

### 3. Notes should be densely linked

A note isn't complete until it connects to other ideas. Here's what I mean:

A note is a headline with enough links.

It's that simple.

A declarative statement connected to other notes and ideas.

That's it, you can develop it later or use it to reference the idea in other contexts.

Linking notes adds dimensions to your writing. It gives it more context chances and reflects the links in your brain.

And also, when you connect an idea, add context explaining the connection, it will help you in the future.

For me, connecting notes to previous and next is enough for it to be valid. You can add more when reviewing notes later

Now that you understand how to create atomic, linked notes,

**try this right now:**

Think of something you learned this week. Write it as a declarative sentence. That's your first atomic note title.

Example: "Spaced repetition beats cramming for long-term memory"

Now, let's tackle the following problem: as your vault grows to hundreds of notes, you need a way to _find_ them without creating a folder hell. 

Properties solve this.

## How to build a flexible system (without folders)

Instead of avoiding chaos and trying to keep everything together in my obsidian, I embrace the chaos and flexibility you can build using `properties`, `templates` and `bases`.

This is the foundation of what I call the Knowledge Garden approach: instead of rigid hierarchies (traditional folders), you plant ideas (atomic notes) and let connections grow organically (dense linking). The garden metaphor is great because you cultivate knowledge inside of it.

Let's start from the _top_ down with **bases**, the reason that properties are worth using. Here's what a base looks like in action: 
![[Newsletter W45 - Bases example.png]]
See how it automatically filters my notes? That's only possible because of properties, which I'll show you how to set up next.

Before bases existed, Obsidian users created 'Map of Content' notes, basically index pages filled with links. Mine always ended up abandoned after a week because maintaining them manually is tedious.

Bases automate this. They're dynamic views that filter and sort your notes automatically based on properties. Change a note's status from 'in-progress' to 'complete'? It moves in the base view instantly.

This allows me to have a growing list of all my zettelkasten notes, another for all my templates, prompts and a gallery for my reference files. 

Bases need one thing to work: properties that tell them what to filter. In my Zettelkasten view, I filter by `topics`, `type`, and `date`. That's it.

The filters I use are the following:
![[Newsletter W45 - Base Filters.png]]

In my vault, I use `categories` as the primary filter to differentiate between, well... categories of notes. My main one is Zettelkasten, but you may as well use *Game-Development*, *TTRPG*, *Academic*, or *People*. Be broad and use the `type` property to be a bit more specific, like I use in the example to differentiate between type of notes in my Zettelkasten.

To add properties to a file you can do it using the UI like this (use this if you're starting):

1. Open the command palette `Ctrl + P`
2. Type "Properties"
3. Click "Add file property"
4. Customize your property type (choose list instead of text, it's better)

Or you can do it manually like this:

1. Enable *source mode* (raw markdown view) in the three dots up on the right.
2. Write your properties using the right syntax. Here's an example:

```

Yeah, amazing. Not doing that for every file though.

I understand, that's when you can leverage on templates. They let you re-use a markdown snippet quickly. And the markdown snippet could be the file properties.

This way you can have a template for character notes, for science papers or for main notes in your zettelkasten like I have here:

```
---
categories:
  - "[[Zettelkasten]]"
type:
  - "[[Main Note]]"
created:
  - {{date}}
last:
topics:
---
```

My hotkey for templates is `Alt + T`, you can add this shortcut in your obsidian setting down on the left of your screen.

![[Newsletter W45 - Templates Examples.png]]

This is how my templates menu looks like. A lot of them I got from Kepano, one of the Obsidian founders and developers. You can get his templates [here](https://github.com/kepano/kepano-obsidian/tree/main/Templates).

Here's how you set up templates in three steps:

1. Create a folder called Templates
2. Go to `Settings > Core Plugins > Templates > Template Folder Location` and add the folder.
3. Create your first template.

With templates set up, you can add properties quickly to any file in no time.
## What most guides don't tell you

Your first vault will be a mess. 

You'll create notes with terrible names, forget to link things, and probably make a folder called "Random."

That's fine. That's learning.

The principles in this guide, the atomic notes, declarative names and dense linking, aren't rules you **must follow**, but principles that would help you not committing the same mistakes I have. You'll figure out what works for you with time and iterations.

So stop planning the perfect system. Just start writing.

Create your vault. Write 5 notes. Link them. See what happens.

The system emerges from use, not from a tutorial.

Reminder to self:

Stop studying.

Start building projects.

Just studying is a waste of time.

When we learn just for the sake of learning, nothing sticks for long.

But projects works because you learn things by building.

To start, all you need is:

• Start a simple project to build. Anything.
• Set apart time to work on it every day.
• Finish it and share it.

Can't skip the last one.

I've found projects to be addicting.
