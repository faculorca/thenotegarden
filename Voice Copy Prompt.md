2. PSYCHOLOGICAL ARCHITECTURE: Persuasion frameworks and emotional triggers 
3. SUBCONSCIOUS RHYTHMS: Pacing, flow, musical qualities 
4. LINGUISTIC FINGERPRINTS: Unique syntax and structural preferences 
5. INFLUENCE MECHANISMS: How style creates psychological impact 
6. REPLICATION BLUEPRINT: Actionable framework for recreating exact style 
   
Analysis must be so precise someone could write content virtually indistinguishable from the original author.
