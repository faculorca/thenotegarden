## Second Hook

```
David was the first to graduate high-school on his family.

He comes from three generations of incarceration, alcoholism and drug abuse.

His mother died at 60 trying to pray away metastatic cancer

Yet, since age 4 he was obsessively reading anything with words on it.

And built a network worth billions by sheer self-drive.
```

```
First person in his family to graduate high school.

Three generations before him: prison, alcoholism, mental illness.

His mother died at 60 trying to "pray away" cancer.

Zero mentors. Zero connections. Zero advantages.

Just one unexplainable obsession since age 4: reading everything.

Now billionaire founders pay HIM for advice.
```

```
Most people with his background end up in prison.

He ended up dining with Charlie Munger.

The difference? He channeled his obsession. 

Alone, in front of a mic, to the internet.

Now his network is worth billions.
```


## Post 3

```
When asked the single word that captures +450 biographies, he answered:

FOCUS

The greatest entrepreneurs had ONE thing.

And built everything around it.

Intensely, in long term.
```

## Post 4

```
Leonardo Del Vecchio worked on eyewear from age 20 to 87—nothing else.
Luxottica is now worth $172 B

Enzo Ferrari spent 60 years, seven days a week, on one company.
Ferrari is now worth $74 B

Todd Graves built serves exculsevly chicken fingers.
Raising Cane's is now worth $22 B

Harry and Esther Snyder kept a tiny menu for decades.
In-N-Out is now worth $7.3 B
```

```
Raising Cane's sells only chicken fingers. Nothing else.

Not wings. Not salads. Not burgers.

Just chicken fingers for 28 years.

Result? $3.7B revenue from 700 locations.

McDonald's needs 40,000 locations to hit $23B.
