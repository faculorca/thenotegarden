One of the most important things I got from this video (https://substack.com/@taylinsimmonds/p-178447726) is that he uses ChatGPT folders as Rambles. So he has Newsletter Rambles, Linkedin Rambles and Worldview Rambles.

This folders are prompted to take whatever he talks and turn them into a structured note. That's the beginning of his process.

The prompt produces:
- Summary
	- Core themes and transformation insights
	- Counter-intuitive truth
	- Tangible pain point
	- Universal principle
- Outline
	- Present the status quo and portrait the problem as painful.
	- Why does this problem matter and the reader should care.
	- A framework around solving this problem in steps.
	- The big payoff, the reward of the opposite to the problem.
- A clean newsletter draft using the voice gave in the first prompt.
