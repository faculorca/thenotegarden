# Creator Flywheels – The Operating System for Your Business

## Highlights
### id944856041

> The flywheel was a large metal disk that used a rotational force to pump instead of a linear up and down force. It was incredibly hard to get started (it took two of us with all of our strength to get a single rotation), but it got easier with every rotation. Once the flywheel had momentum, I could spin it easily with one hand.

> As a creator, you often take the traditional hand pump approach without realizing it.

> At rest, a flywheel is heavy and hard to rotate. But once you get it spinning, it becomes easier to keep spinning.

> For a flywheel to be effective, it needs to meet three criteria: 
> 1. Activities flow smoothly from one into the next
> 2. Each rotation is *easier* than the previous rotation
> 3. Each rotation *produces more* than the previous rotation
> It should grow smoother, easier, and more effective with each rotation.
