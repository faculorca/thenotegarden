> Authenticity is the great mirage of the modern age.

> So what we actually need, especially for our youth, is an unmaking of expectation – the suffocating demand that they ruthlessly optimise and curate every element of their lives for public presentation just to access a fraction of the economic prosperity their parents enjoyed. Because we’ve created a world where turning yourself into a brand isn’t a lifestyle choice but a survival strategy, particularly as AI puts a blowtorch to the remaining areas of knowledge work that once promised middle-class security.
