# Don't Be Such a Scientist

## Highlights
### id940342188

> The truth is, scientists are humans, and from the outset they rely on "induction, " which draws on the highly human faculty of . . . intuition. What this means is that a scientist doesn't sit down and come up with twenty-five hypotheses to explain, perhaps, why only the top branches of a given tree species bear fruit. The scientist realizes from the outset that most of the possible hypotheses simply are not likely (the hypothesis that trees learn this behavior from their parents—not an idea really worth testing, you know) and quickly narrows them down to just a few reasonable ideas.
> And this is where Medawar says the scientific paper is a fraud. The scientist tells himself that he is writing up "just the facts, "

- [n] There's a lot of intuition and non-objectivity in science. But science don't like to talk about that, because "They're facts, ma'am"

> Just ask a mathematician about concision. It's the difference between the clumsy mathematician who needs 100 steps to solve an equation and the skilled one who can do it in 5 simple steps. The latter is arrived at either by genius or by hard work. And that's all I'm advocating for science communication—that you be either a genius or a hard worker. That you accept that poor communicators are able to say the same basic things as good communicators—they just need a lot more time and space in which to do it, which ends up boring everyone.

> Do you really need proof of this? If you do, go visit a research laboratory, walk into any lab, and ask the guy with the thickest glasses, "So what are you studying here?" Then take a seat, put your elbow on the table, chin in palm, and settle in for a half-hour ramble. How do I know this? Because I was one of those guys when I was a postdoctoral fellow at the Australian Institute of Marine Science. Tourists would ask about my automated underwater starfish larvae growth chambers and I would unleash a longwinded discourse that I felt wasn't finished until I had put out the fires of their curiosity. "D'ya wanna know more?" I'd proudly ask their backsides as they fled out the door.

> As part of that last interest, he wrote a very interesting short article in 1963 titled "Is the Scientific Paper a Fraud?" He answered his question with a resounding yes:"The scientific paper is a fraud in the sense that it does give a totally misleading narrative of the processes of thought that
> go into the making of scientific discoveries."

> The discussion which in the traditional scientific paper goes last should surely come at the beginning. The scientific facts and scientific acts should follow the discussion, and scientists should not be ashamed to admit, as many of them are apparently ashamed to admit, that hypotheses appear in their minds along uncharted by-ways of thought; that they are imaginative and inspirational in character; that they are indeed adventures of the mind

> It's an interesting dilemma scientists face. They have to strive for objectivity and removal of bias—science loses its meaning if it turns into nothing but unsubstantiated opinions. Yet scientists, and the public in general, have to be reminded over and over again that science is conducted by human beings, not machines.

> "Dumbing down" refers to the assumption that your audience is too stupid to understand your topic. So you water down all the information or just remove it, producing a vacuous and uninteresting version of what in reality is complex and fascinating. "Concision" is completely different. It means conveying a great deal of information using the fewest possible steps or words or images or whatever the mode of communication is. The former results in a dull, shallow presentation; the latter is a thing of beauty that can project infinite complexity.

   Being concise means conveying a lot of valuable information in as fewest and simple words, images or whatever.
   The first have dull and shallow results; the second can project infinite complexity and fascination.
