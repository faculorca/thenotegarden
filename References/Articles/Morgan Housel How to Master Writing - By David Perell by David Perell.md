> Now, a lot of the philosophers and whatnot that have been translated over the years, they were not the best writers. They’re very deep thinkers. You can learn a tremendous amount from them, but you really have to crank the gears in your brain to get it.

- [n] I always thought of philosophers as great writers. But they can not be, they are deep thinkers, that doesn't mean clear thinkers.

> I think there’s other people who can tell a story that can be equally profound that you can just get. One of the great examples of this is the author Eric Larson, who writes non-fiction stuff.

> What he does better than anyone is that in his nonfiction books, sometimes there can be 200 chapters in the book. Each chapter is a page and a half. The reason he can do that is because he can tell in a page and a half what would take other historians 17 pages.

> Mark Twain wrote about this. He used to read aloud to his wife and kids, and he would watch their facial expressions, and when they leaned forward, he’d be like, oh, I’m onto something. And when he could see them getting bored, he’d be like, gotta cut it, gotta cut it, gotta cut it. And that’s why some of that writing is so good. It’s very heavily curated to get to the point.

> if you have to reread the paragraph four times because it’s deep writing, it’s not bedtime writing. That’s not on you; that’s the author’s fault. It’s supposed to be easy to read, and you can be deep and insightful and communicate well.

> He can just get to the point, and he’s not taking out any of the meat. He’s just getting to the point, and I think I retain, and most people retain so much more to just get to the point. Get to the fricking point.
