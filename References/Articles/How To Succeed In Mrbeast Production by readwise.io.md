# How To Succeed In Mrbeast Production

## Highlights

> I could make a separate book for creative, a separate book for production, a separate book for editors, etc. but I think that'd be dumb. Everything we do here is interconnected and the more you understand about what others are doing and trying to accomplish, the better set up for success you will be.

> I've seen a team of 5 people work on a project for a week just to give up and James solve it in 30 minutes. I say this not to flex for him but to show the power that comes when you understand everything in this book deeply. The more you know about why we do things and what we are trying to accomplish, the better off you will be. So let's start off with some basic stuff.

> **What is your goal here?**
> Your goal here is to make the best YOUTUBE videos possible. That's the number one goal of this production company. It's not to make the best produced videos. Not to make the funniest videos. Not to make the best looking videos. Not the highest quality videos.. It's to make the best YOUTUBE videos possible. Everything we want will come if we strive for that. Sounds obvious but after 6 months in the weeds a lot of people tend to forget what we are actually trying to achieve here.

- [n] Set a goal. Work towards it. Be accountable of following that path. Become the best.

> Youtube is the future and I believe with every fiber of my body it's going to keep growing year over year and in 5 years Youtube will be bigger than anyone will have ever imagined and I want this channel to be at the top. Which is why I say we are not Hollywood. 99% of movies or tv shows would flop on Youtube. On top of that they'd be wildly unprofitable, have no flexibility, and long lead times that can't adapt to trends.

> at the end of the day you will be judged on results, not hours. We are a results based company. Get shit done and move the goalpost!

> You're either an A-Player, B-Player, or C-Player. There is only room in this company for A-Players.

> A-Players are obsessive, learn from mistakes, coachable, intelligent, don't make excuses, believe in Youtube, see the value of this company, and are the best in the goddamn world at their job. B-Players are new people that need to be trained into A-Players, and C-Players are just average employees. They don't suck but they arn't exceptional at what they do. They just exist, do whatever, and get a paycheck. They arn't obsessive
> and learning. C-Players are poisonous and should be transitioned to a different company IMMEDIATELY. (It's okay we give everyone severance, they'll be fine). **Chapter 1: What makes a Youtube video viral?**
