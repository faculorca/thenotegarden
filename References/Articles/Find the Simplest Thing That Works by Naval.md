## Highlights

> **Naval:** There’s a theory in [complexity theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity_theory) that whenever you find a complex system working in nature, it’s usually the output of a very simple system or thing that was iterated over and over.

> And this is one of [Musk’s](https://x.com/elonmusk) great driving principles where he basically says: Before you optimize a system, that’s among the last things that you do. Before you start trying to figure out how to make something more efficient, the first thing you do is you question the requirements.

> You’re like, “Why does the requirement even exist?”

> One of the Elon methods in [Jorgenson’s new book](https://www.elonmuskbook.org/) is you first go and you track down the requirement. And not which department came up with the requirement; the requirement has to come from an individual.

> The most critical person to take a great product from [zero to one](https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296) is the single person—[usually the founder](https://x.com/naval/status/1903559048089485593)—who can hold the entire problem in their head and make the trade-offs, and understand why each component is where it is.

> It’s funny—everybody says “I’m a generalist,” which is their way of copping out on being a specialist. But really what you want to be is a polymath, which is a generalist who can pick up every specialty, at least to the [80/20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) level, so they can make smart trade-offs.

> What doesn’t work as well is the reverse. When you design a very complex system and then you try to make a functioning large system out of that, it just falls apart.

> a lot of product design is iterating on your own designs until you find the simple thing that works.
