> short, and if you want to start now, here’s what I’d recommend:
> 1. **Audit your time** – note activities where, if you stop doing them, the results stop.
> 2. **Develop a high-leverage skill** – invest 1-2 hours daily for 6-12 months into writing, coding, sales, or marketing, and once you have money, investing.
> 3. **Build your own thing** – a blog, YouTube channel, newsletter, digital product, app, template library, investment portfolio, physical product, etc. *Start the business.*
> 4. **Automate and systemize** – for repetitive tasks, create templates or checklists, document the process, refine it until it gets the most results it can, and potentially use automation tools or AI to take it a step further.
> 5. **Find your tribe** – attempt to help 3 people per month with no expectation of return, join communities where like-minded people or potential customers are, and share what you are learning publicly on social media.
> 6. **Practice hiring and training** – hire a VA for basic admin tasks, partner with someone whose skills complement yours, and when problems become too painful for you to solve on your own, bring adaptable people onto your team.
> 7. **Scalable income streams** – negotiate equity or commission as an employee, convert a service into a product as an entrepreneur, etc.
> 8. **Distribution = freedom** – build an email list, build an audience, make content a dedicated part of your deep work blocks.
> No matter where I research more about leverage (in an attempt to ensure that my own bias doesn’t take over here) the “fast track” advice seems to always be: learn a valuable skill, create content, and invest your cash back into assets that compound.
