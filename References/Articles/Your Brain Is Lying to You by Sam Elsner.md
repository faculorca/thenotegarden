# Your Brain Is Lying to You

## Highlights
### id943543506

> Dr. Joan Vickers spent decades studying expert perception. Her research on *quiet eye* reveals something profound about how skilled performers actually work.

- [n] Sometimes this small ways of expressing things shout AI, and it feels shallow. "reveals something profound about how it actually works" do you really talk like that?

### id943548461

> Dr. Keith Davids calls this the *transfer problem.* Skills trained in one context don’t automatically transfer to different contexts. Not because of insufficient practice. But because skilled behavior is specific to the perceptual information available in performance environments.

### id943549054

> Instead of isolating skills and drilling technique, you design practice environments that preserve the perceptual information from performance contexts. You manipulate constraints—especially task constraints—to guide the emergence of skilled coordination without imposing a single *correct* solution.

### id943549431

> Constraints-led approach recognizes that skilled coordination emerges from the interaction of all three constraint categories. No single correct solution. Multiple functional coordination patterns possible based on how constraints interact for each performer.

### id943549494

> But here’s why it’s rarely implemented: it requires coaches to give up control. Traditional coaching feels productive—you’re teaching, correcting, instructing. You’re fixing individual constraints through imposed technique.

### id943549607

> The solution isn’t better training programs. It’s embedding skill development in authentic work environments where perception-action coupling with relevant information can develop.

> I need to write long-form. I can’t help it. It’s how I think. How I process. How I make sense of the research that’s reshaping how I understand human performance.

### id943543076

> Gibson spent his career studying perception. Not how we process sensory information. Not how we construct mental representations. But how we directly perceive opportunities for action in the environment.
> He called these opportunities *affordances.*
> A staircase affords climbing. 
> A chair affords sitting. 
> A ball affords throwing.

### id943543263

> Gibson proved that skilled action *emerges* from direct coupling between perception and action systems. Not from cognitive control mediating between separate perceptual and motor processes.

> Your brain’s role isn’t to control performance. It’s to facilitate the coupling between perception and action within environmental constraints.

### id943543870

> Experts aren’t concentrating more intensely. They’re extracting different *information from the environment.*

- [n] Here too, every paragraph feels authentic, but some of them have a punchline loaded with this shallow and weird feeling.
   This negation to punchline is too repeated.

> Expert surgeons aren’t concentrating harder on making precise cuts. They’re attuning to tissue properties, instrument feedback, and visual information.

> The *focus* isn’t happening in their heads. It’s happening in the coupling between their perception and the environment.

> The implications are staggering

- [n] this hyping-up of what you are about to say, when repeated, get's a bit tiring.

### id943544782

> This isn’t mysticism. It’s not some magical flow state. It’s the subjective experience of perception-action coupling operating without interference from conscious control.

- [n] Change the structure of your paragraphs. Trying something like "This all seem like mysticism, but it's not. Is not a magical flow state either."
