# I Deleted My Second Brain

## Highlights
### id943279697

> But over time, my second brain became a mausoleum. A dusty collection of old selves, old interests, old compulsions, piled on top of each other like geological strata. Instead of accelerating my thinking, it began to replace it. Instead of aiding memory, it froze my curiosity into static categories.

> PKM systems promise coherence, but they often deliver a kind of abstracted confusion. The more I wrote into my vault, the less I felt. A quote would spark an insight, I’d clip it, tag it, link it - and move on. But the insight was never lived. It was stored. Like food vacuum-sealed and never eaten, while any nutritional value slips away.

> The “second brain” metaphor is both ambitious and (to a degree) biologically absurd. Human memory is not an archive. It is associative, embodied, contextual, emotional. We do not think in folders. We do not retrieve meaning through backlinks. Our minds are improvisational. They forget on purpose.

### id943280087

> In trying to remember everything, I outsourced the act of reflection. I didn’t revisit ideas. I didn’t interrogate them. I filed them away and trusted the structure. But a structure is not thinking. A tag is not an insight. And an idea not re-encountered might as well have never been had.

> Every tool changes the shape of the hand that uses it.

> Obsidian is a brilliant piece of software. I love it, dearly. But like anything, without restraint, it can also be a trap. Markdown files in nested folders. Plugins that track your productivity. Graph views that suggest omniscience. There’s an illusion of mastery in watching your notes web into constellations. But constellations are projections. They tell stories. They do not guarantee understanding.

> I write knowing it may disappear. I highlight books knowing the highlights will fade. I trust that what matters will return, will find its way to the surface. I no longer worship the permanence of text.

> I still love Obsidian. And I’m planning on using it again. From scratch. And with a deeper level of curation and care - not as a second brain, but as a workspace for the one I already have.

> Merlin Donald, in his theory of cognitive evolution, argues that human intelligence emerged not from static memory storage but from *external symbolic representation*: tools like language, gesture, and writing that allowed us to rehearse, share, and restructure thought.

> When I first started using PKM tools, I believed I was solving a problem of forgetting.

> The more my system grew, the more I deferred the work of thought to some future self who would sort, tag, distill, and extract the gold.

### id943280880

> My new system is, simply, no system at all. I write what I think. I delete what I don’t need. I don’t capture everything. I don’t try to. I read what I feel like. I think in conversation, in movement, in context. I don’t build a second brain.
