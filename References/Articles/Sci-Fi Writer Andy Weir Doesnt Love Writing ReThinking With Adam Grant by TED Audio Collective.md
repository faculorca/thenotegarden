## Highlights

> people who are in the business and just ask my advice because they erroneously think I know things
> what I tell them is that imagine you're a sculptor instead of a writer and you're you're driving along and you see this big chunk of marble out in the field and you're like you know what I I the the shape of it and the the the the texture of it that would be perfect for like a statue of Zeus you buy it from a farmer who owns it then you go and you get your your truck and you get like a winch and you do all this stuff this thing weighs like four tons you've gotta
> get it up into your truck then you drive it to your workshop and then you you've got to do just all this back-breaking labor to get that chunk of marble into your workshop and there you go now your way you just start carving the statue of Zeus so all that work you did right there that's like the first draft for a writer that's like so you have completed the entire book before you've really started

- [n] Imagine you are a sculptor instead of a writer. So you see the raw material and say "you know what, that would be perfect for a statue of Zeus" or something like that.
   You have to put that stone into your truck, realize it weights a ton, then put it down on you house and break your back removing those big chunks of marble.
   That's the first draft for a writer. You have to complete a whole book before you start the book.

> or me the hardest part of writing is sitting my lazy ass down and writing like what what's that old joke it's a joke that's like older than me I'm sure or is it a guy two guys at a bar one of them says I'm I'm writing a novel and the other one says yeah neither am I [Laughter] there's a bit of a mystery for me here which is if if you're in love with the result and that's what motivates you

- [n] Some people really enjoy the process of writing. Andy is not one of them, it's hard and unpleasent. You do it because you like the result, like gardening or training. It sucks in the process, the results feel great.

> I mean your stories are so original I would actually disagree with you there believe it or not I don't think my stories are that original I've accidentally come up with my own way of telling well trodden ground stories so I'm a hard sci-fi
> author I like to stick to real science as much as possible and that's just because I'm a science dork it's it's it's my hobby my passion these are this is what's interesting to me everybody's good at their hobby right if if I was a Gearhead if I was way into cars then maybe I'd write stories about cars you know but I'm I'm all about the science so that's just what I'm into if you just write down the basic plot outline you know of of my stories without any
> editorializing or any opinion they're very well trodden ground an astronaut is stranded on Mars okay like there was a movie in the 1950s called Robinson Crusoe on Mars like where he is stranded on Mars like the the exact same plot right my second book Artemis that no one remembers that's like you know a a criminal a low stakes criminal living in a city in space and then finally project Hail Mary is like a first Contact story
> like it's been done so the only thing that I bring to the table is I I try to do it with like my own like obsessive attention to like scientific detail and that that ends up taking the story in places that a lot of the other ones don't but so while I appreciate you claiming that I have original ideas I think I don't I think I just have like my own way of doing really really well

- [n] Andy don't think his stories are original. He's a hard sci-fi writer who likes to write real scientific things, and he is great at it because he loves it.
   Everybody is good at their hobbies.
   The plot of his three books are things that has already been done:
   A guy stranded in Mars
   A guy who is a detective on space
   First-contact story

> I'm passionate about science but I'm also kind of a dumbass so I have to look up so my thing is I know enough to know how to find out what I need to do to solve a science problem so I know how to look it up and how to follow the instructions
