## Part 1

2:10 | Role playing games guides are a really good source of information, because their whole product is teaching you how to tell a good story. [[Dan Wells]] base his presentation around the book Start Trek RPG. As a comment, I'd like to add [[Mothership]] as a good source of how to tell good horror stories.

2:46 | Dan called his story structure system "[[The Seven Point System]]" that consists of:
	- Hook
	- Plot Turn 1
	- Pinch 1
	- Midpoint
	- Pinch 2
	- Plot Turn 2
	- Resolution

3:31 | **About building a story**. You have to start a story in mind before you write the story. Not everybody writes this way. There are architects and gardeners, as [[George R.R. Martin]] says and [[Brandon Sanderson]] also teaches in his writing lessons. *(I had a note about this, but I lost it lol)*

4:35 | Before the structure of a story, you need a solid idea of what that story is about:
	- Who are the characters.
	- What is the setting.
	- What is the major conflict.

4:50 | **Start at the end**. Everything in the story leads to this point, you need to make sure what kind of resolution you want to have.

5:42 | This climax can be plot-centered or character-centered. In this case, Dan uses as example the fist Harry Potter book ([[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]). The climax point of the book is "Harry defeats Voldemort". With that ending, we can now figure out where to start.

7:28 | In the case of [[Batman Begins]], the movie ends with Batman in a position of great strength. He knows what he is doing and beat all the bad guys. So he starts at the complete opposite of that. A simple arc of growth.

7:52 | Different to [[The Dark Knight]] movie where he is already powerful and the arc is a shift. From one kind of strength to another one.

## Part 2

0:44 | Continuing with the Harry Potter example, he has to end up defeating voldemort and starts by having a sad, boring life. So the midpoint has to be Harry learning the truth about the sorcerer's stone and swearing to protect it from Voldemort. This midpoint is where the protagonist makes the shift from reaction to action. "Let's do somthing about this."

01:31 | In regards of the **Plot Turn 1 (PT1)**,  just as the midpoint moves you from beginning to end, PT1 moves you from beginning to midpoint. This is where the conflict is introduced and the character world changes. New people appear, secrets unveil and the protagonist starts following the white rabbit. 

2:04 | This can take the form as a Call to Adventure or Confront New Ideas. This point set the story in motion and puts the character on a path that they are doing things and reacting to stuff, trying to solve something.

2:26 | In Harry Potter this PT1 is "Harry, you're a wizard."

2:46 | The **Plot Turn 2 (PT2)** will move the story from the midpoint to the end. At the midpoint the character determine to do something. At PT the character finally does it. This is where you obtain the final thing you need to make it happen. "The power is in you!"

3:34 | This structure can sound cheesy, the *power is in you* thing often sound like... weird. But in the words of Dan Wells, this is supposed to happen. The outline SHOULD be cheesy, there is not an outline in the world that doesn't sound stupid when you describe it to somebody. Don't be afraid of cheesy things.

4:10 | This is also where the part "Grasping victory from the jaws of defeat" happens. Something horrible happens, but now the hero have what they need, even if they don't realize at the time.

5:30 | A good example of this is in Star Wars, where Luke has lost the light saber battle and his hand, he is cooked, but he's able to find feeling in Darth Vader, so there could be a chance of turning this horrible situation on his favor.

5:45 | The PT2 will give us the final piece from trying to succeed into finally succeeding. In Harry Potter, the "Power is in you" is when he discovers the stone in his pocket because **his motives are pure**.

6:21 | Now in respect of pinches, they're designed to apply pressure. And the main purpose of them is to force the characters to take action. In the case of Harry Potter, in the first book this children are 11 year old and they have to defeat the person the whole world fears, so they need to be forced into it, because they won't make it by themselves.

6:57 | As in Harry Potter there are no adults around, they're forced against their will to fight with the tools they have, and it also adds a bit of danger and fun to a place that for now has been magic, cafeterias and people flying on brooms. The pinch in this case is the troll attack.

7:31 | The Pinch 2 applies more pressure up until the situation seems hopeless: the plan fails, a mentor dies, the hero lose everything or the bad guys seem to win. These are the jaws of defeat from which the hero will be snatching victory. Dan also states that you should "make sure the teeth are sharp."

8:45 | In Harry Potter they go down into the dungeon and loses Ron and Hermione to the traps, so Harry is left alone against Voldemort.

9:29 | At this point, the story is far for complete, but we have the skeleton, and needs flesh to fill it out: Round characters, rich environments, the "Ice Monster" Prologue, try/fail cycles and subplots (depending on size).

## Part 3

1:42 | Romance. In this part, Dan compares Pride & Prejudge with the structure we saw in Harry Potter.
