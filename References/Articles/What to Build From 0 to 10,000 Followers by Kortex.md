> Specific Actions (1-2 hours a day)
> Timeblock 1-2 hours to accomplish the following every single day.
> You can batch posts and threads on one day of the week if you'd like to.
> • **3-5 DMs a day** - so you build a network, have people to share your content, and potentially land clients for your service (when you have one). You need people to know who you are and spread your name.
> • **2-3 posts a day** - so you can suck at first and get better. These won't do that well right now, but you need something for people to share so you can grow. You also need content on your profile so potential followers know what you talk about.
> • **1-2 threads, long posts, or micro-articles a week** - so you can build authority and gain followers faster. Only write threads if you have a network that can help you spread them with reposts or shares.
> • **10-50 replies a day** - so you can get in front of people who are going through the comments on large accounts. Do not right simple meaningless replies. Write a personal experience around the topic of the post. Start with "I remember when I..."
> • **Bonus: 1 promotion a day** - if you have a lead magnet, product, or service promote it once a day, because how else are you going to get customers?
> • **Sending 1 good post a day to network** – get your content shared by sending your best post of the day (especially threads) to the network you've built so you can actually grow.
> • **Consider paying for growth** – not ads. Ask bigger personal brands if they help with growth, see what their rates are, and share your best posts with them to gain traction.
> Create a timeblock for those in your mornings or whenever you have quiet time to focus.
