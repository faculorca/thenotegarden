# The Collector’s Fallacy

## Highlights
### id941691189

> Let’s call this “The Collector’s Fallacy”. Why fallacy? Because ‘to know about something’ isn’t the same as ‘knowing something’

> Umberto Eco in his book [“How to Write a Thesis”](https://www.amazon.com/How-Write-Thesis-MIT-Press/dp/0262527138/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=ctzettelkasten-20&linkId=74f6517a8c4df9f357cf9781972b7fb1&language=en_US): (1)[1](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/#fn:aff) “there’s a lot someone doesn’t know anything about precisely because she photocopied a text; she has given herself in to the illusion of having read the text already.”

> to take a photocopy of a text is so much faster than actually reading it and learning what’s inside

> Collecting, just as Eco warned us, does not magically increase our knowledge. We have to read a text effectively to assimilate its ideas and learn from it. Reading effectively means the text changes our knowledge permanently. Only when we learn from it and begin to work with the ideas it presents. We need to extract what’s inside and write things down.

> If we read without taking notes, our knowledge increases for a short time only.

> To increase one’s knowledge is a meaningful and the only sustainable way of working with information. Instead of shoveling information from the source text into your own project with the help of your working memory, you can integrate it into your knowledge system once and have it available forever. We may expand our knowledge permanently only by storing notes permanently.

> Taking notes thoroughly means you can rely on your notes alone and rarely need to look up a detail in the original text.

> I rarely consult secondary sources again. If I have to do so, it means that
