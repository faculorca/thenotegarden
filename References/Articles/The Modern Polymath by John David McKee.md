# The Modern Polymath

## Highlights
### id950576821

> The **Traditional Polymath** spent the majority of their time finding new information, which until recently was extremely difficult to do. Most fields of knowledge were in their infancy, presenting a different challenge and opportunity than we have today.

> But this also represented an opportunity. Polymaths could ‘master’ broad subjects and make significant contributions to those fields because the limited information provided curious minds with ample opportunities to make new discoveries.

- [n] There was a smaller amount of information, and it was hard to reach.
   So being a polymath was harder, but it was also more rewarding. There were a big amount of discoveries to make, and contributions to almost every field of knowledge.

Epstein found that Nobel Laureates (winners of the Nobel Prize) when compared to other scientists, were **22 times** more likely to partake as an amateur actor, dancer, magician, or some other type of performer. Yes, 22x.

> It’s like adding a new tool to your toolbox. When you first start out, you might have a hammer, screwdriver, and some pliers. But as you add more tools you realize how to best use each of these to more effectively and efficiently do the job you’re trying to do. The polymath’s toolbox is full of ‘tools’ so that they can objectively decide which tool to use, rather than being limited by a small set of tools.

And virtually everyone will have to adapt to working alongside machines in new ways.

### id950593602

> This is what the polymath does. They pull from various different areas to solve problems. They recognize that everything is relative, and by being able to connect dots across different fields they’re able to come up with creative solutions that couldn’t be reached by someone who is only a subject matter expert in one specific area. They see the “big picture” in ways others can’t because of their knowledge base is both broad and deep, seeing connections and inspiration where most “experts” never even thought to look.

### id950593654

> But building this toolbox, these skillsets, requires a vision of what you want to achieve in life and what you’re interested in so that you can build a learning agenda that will help you define and reach your goals. No professional athlete just picked up a ball and was instantly the best in the world at that sport. Nor has a writer sat down and unintentionally written a book. It takes strategy, intentional effort and patience to accomplish anything. **You have to have a clear target defined! You can’t hit a target if you don’t know what it is.**

- [n] Goal oriented thinking. If you don't have a goal that pulls you towards a better version of yourself, you are losing potential growth.
   This also has relation with the concept of anti-vision. Sometimes having your own vision of the life you want to live is not that easy, but defining the life you DON'T want to live sometimes is easier.
   Pushing away from the life you don't want to live can be a even stronger than pulling towards the life you want.

   Get the college degree, get a good job and keep doing it for 30 years (and get a PhD if you can).
   Specialization is for insects.

> The man whose whole life is spent in performing a few simple operations, of which the effects are perhaps always the same, or very nearly the same, has no occasion to exert his understanding or to exercise his invention in finding out expedients for removing difficulties which never occur.

It seemed obvious to them after a while. That’s because they were able to connect experiences they’ve had and synthesize new things. And the reason they were able to do that was that they’ve had more experiences or they have thought more about their experiences than other people.”
