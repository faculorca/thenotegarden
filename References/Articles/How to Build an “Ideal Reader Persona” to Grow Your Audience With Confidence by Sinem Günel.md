> The easiest way to get started with your reader persona is by answering demographic questions: What’s her age? Where is she from? Where is she living? Are you writing for men, women, or both? Does gender even play a role?
> What’s her background?
> What are the beliefs she grew up with? What did she study? Where does she work? What are her hobbies and interests?
> What are her goals?
> What does she want to achieve? What are her big aims in life? And why does she need your advice?
> What are her challenges and fears?
> Relate this question to your content: Which problems could you help her solve through your writing? Are you writing educational stories? Step-by-step guides? Or just inspiring/funny stories that make her forget about her busy life, so she can relax and enjoy a few minutes of peaceful reading?
> If you can write stories that help your ideal reader overcome her challenges and achieve her goals, you’ll be able to build a lasting bond.
