# Scientific Advertising

## Highlights
### id948328888

> Nearly every selling question which arises in business is accurately answered by many experiences.

### id947408094

> Under these conditions, where they long exist, advertising and merchandising become exact sciences. Every course is charted. The compass of accurate knowledge directs the shortest, safest, cheapest course to any destination.

- [n] Marketing is a science.
   That's an interesting concept to explore.

### id947408110

> We learn the principles and prove them by repeated tests. This is done through keyed advertising, by traced returns, largely by the use of coupons.

### id947408257

> But those figures are not final. One ad may bring too many worthless replies, another replies that are valuable. So our final conclusions are always based on cost per customer or cost per dollar of sale.

- [n] This applies perfectly to the concept of building an audience based on viral shallow stuff or build an engaged audience.

### id947417091

> One must be able to express himself briefly, clearly and convincingly, just as a salesman must. But fine writing is a distinct disadvantage. So is unique literary style. They take attention from the subject. They reveal the hook. Any studied attempt to sell, if apparent, creates corresponding resistance.

### id947417175

> Some say, "Be very brief. People will read but little." Would you say that to a salesman? With a prospect standing before him, would you confine him to any certain number of words? That would be an unthinkable handicap.

 * [View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k7dnm4p6df69sw5hmwj9d91n)

### id947417183

> So in advertising. The only readers we get are people whom our subject interests. No one reads ads for amusement, long or short. Consider them as prospects standing before you, seeking for information. Give them enough to get action.

 * [View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k7dnmme6110qgk6t70mgsc2k)

### id947542650

> So with countless questions. Measure them by salesmen's standards, not by amusement standards. Ads are not written to entertain. When they do, those entertainment seekers are little likely to be the people whom you want.

### id947542790

> Some advertising men go out in person and sell to people before they plan or write an ad. One of the ablest of them has spent weeks on one article, selling from house to house. In this way they learn the reactions from different forms of argument and approach. They learn what possible buyers want and the factors which don't appeal. It is quite customary to interview hundreds of possible customers.

- [n] This keeps the advertisers near to the marketers and designers. The people who make the ads should not work afar from the people who sell directly. It's similar to what Elon does in his companies, keeping the engineers and designers near the production line. This way you can attack the root problem ASAP.

### id947544330

> The maker of an advertised article knows the manufacturing side and probably the dealer's side. But this very knowledge often leads him astray in respect to consumers. His interests are not their interests.

- [n] Again, the importance of talking to the consumer and creating a narrative surrounding them.

### id947545512

> Ads are planned and written with some utterly wrong conception. They are written to please the seller. The interests of the buyer are forgotten. One can never sell goods profitably, in person or in print, when that attitude exists.

- [n] The mentality most advertisers have is to satisfy the seller, when the important person is the buyer, or mor specifically, the user.

### id947546074

> The best ads ask no one to buy. That is useless. Often they do not quote a price. They do not say that dealers handle the product.

 * [View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k7ergk1tsys3kd5yytn4f6kc)

### id947549558

> Some of these ads seem altruistic. But they are based on a knowledge of human nature. The writers know how people are led to buy.

### id947549575

> The good salesman does not merely cry a name. He doesn't say, "Buy my article." He pictures the customer's side of his service until the natural result is to buy.

> Another concern sells coffee, etc., by wagons in some 500 cities. The man drops in with a half-pound of coffee and says, "Accept this package and try it. I'll come back in a few days to ask how you like it."

### id947550384

> The maker of an electric sewing machine motor found advertising difficult. So, on good advice, he ceased soliciting a purchase. He offered to send to any home, through any dealer, a motor for one week's use. With it would come a man to show how to operate it. "Let us help you for a week without cost or obligation," said the ad. Such an offer was resistless, and about nine in ten of the trials led to sales.

- [n] An offer so good you feel stupid saying no.

### id947551412

> Sometimes the advertiser uses small ads, sometimes large ads. None are too small to tell a reasonable story. But an ad twice larger brings twice the returns. A four-times-larger ad brings four times the returns, and usually some in addition.

- [n] The more copy the better. I don't think this principle stands too well on todays reality. We are exposed to way too much ads 24/7, so we detect immediately and want to go straight to the point.
   This has changed.

### id947552343

> So in an advertisement. What you have will interest certain people only, and for certain reasons. You care only for those people. Then create a headline which will hail those people only.

### id947554920

> The writer of this chapter spends far more time on headlines than on writing. He often spends hours on a single headline. Often scores of headlines are discarded before the right one is selected. For the entire return from an ad depends on attracting the right sort of readers. The best of salesmanship has no chance whatever unless we get a hearing.

### id947561953

> The competent advertising man must understand psychology. The more he knows about it the better. He must learn that certain effects lead to certain reactions, and use that knowledge to increase results and avoid mistakes.

 * [View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k7ev15h1c1zxedqe34xk2g5y)

### id947562014

> Human nature is perpetual. In most respects it is the same today as in the time of Caesar. So the principles of psychology are fixed and enduring. You will never need to unlearn what you learn about them.

> Then he said, "Try our rivals' too"—said it in his headlines. He invited comparisons and showed that he did not fear them. That corrected the situation. Buyers were careful to get the brand so conspicuously superior that its maker could court a trial of the rest.

- [n] This reminded me of the stategy used by Hypefury, a publishing tool. He benchamarks versus all of their rivals. They even have articles on "hypefury vs tweethunter" or whatever other platform.

### id947563740

### id947565113

> There are endless phases to psychology. Some people know them by instinct. Many of them are taught by experience. But we learn most of them from others. When we see a winning method we note it down for use when occasion offers.

### id947764790

> Platitudes and generalities roll off the human understanding like water from a duck. They leave no impression whatever. To say, "Best in the world," "Lowest prices in existence," etc., are at best simply claiming the expected. But superlatives of that sort are usually damaging. They suggest looseness of expression, a tendency to exaggerate, a carelessness of truth. They lead readers to discount all the statements that you make.

- [n] it's easy to be shallow.
   if you're shallow, you immediatly lost attention

### id947764880

> But a man who makes a specific claim is either telling the truth or a lie. People do not expect an advertiser to lie. They know that he can't lie in the best mediums. The growing respect for advertising has largely come through a growing regard for its truth.

### id947764894

> So a definite statement is usually accepted. Actual figures are not generally discounted. Specific facts, when stated, have their full weight and effect.

- [n] this is yet another similarity with science. Marketing and science are way more related than some academics want to accept.

### id947981478

> In the old days all beers were advertised as "Pure." The claim made no impression. The bigger the type used, the bigger the folly. After millions had been spent to impress a platitude, one brewer pictured a plate glass room where beer was cooled in filtered air. He pictured a filter of white wood pulp through which every drop was cleared. He told how bottles were washed four times by machinery. How he went down 4,000 feet for pure water. How 1,018 experiments had been made to attain a yeast to give beer that matchless flavor. And how all the yeast was forever made from that adopted mother cell.

- [n] Avoid the platitudes going for specific facts. Instead of saying the platitude for the result, tell the story of the process.

### id947982815

### id948329432

> The advertisements seem monotonous to the men who read them all. A complete story is always the same. But one must consider that the average reader is only once a reader, probably. And what you fail to tell him in that ad is something he may never know.

### id948329483

> Some advertisers go so far as to never change their ads. Single mail order ads often run year after year without diminishing returns. So with some general ads. They are perfected ads, embodying in the best way known all that one has to say. Advertisers do not expect a second reading. Their constant returns come from getting new readers.

- [n] You can craft a very good piece of copy and reuse it for your advertising almost forever. People won't read it twice, you should aim to new readers

> So never waste one line of your space to say something to present users, unless you can say it in headlines. Bear in mind always that you address an unconverted prospect.

- [n] It's really interesting how in this book, space is a precious resource as it is ink that cost money. So the less space you use, the better.
   It's not only a mental limitation optimizing for short attention spans, it's an economical one for optimizing profits.

> Changing people's habits is very expensive. A project which involves that must be seriously considered. To sell shaving soap to the peasants of Russia one would first need to change their beard-wearing habits. The cost would be excessive. Yet countless advertisers try to do things almost as impossible. Just because questions are not ably considered, and results are untraced and unknown.
