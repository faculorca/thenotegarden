# A System for Writing: How an Unconventional Approach to Note-Making Can Help You Capture Ideas, Think Wildly, and Write Constantly - A Zettelkasten Primer

## Highlights

> Each has staked a claim in the land of PKM, united in a shared belief that “The mind is for having ideas, not holding them.”[7](private://read/01k5s99srw0kyxdyn4bmajfyp8/part0000_split_020.html#_idTextAnchor116) Taken from David Allen’s seminal text on productivity, Getting Things Done, this idea, above all others, binds lawyers to Luddites, helping thousands who struggle to put ideas into action.

> As we engage with a barrage of information hurtling toward us at ever-increasing speeds, the necessity to externalize our thinking to make sense of what we encounter has become not only a convenience, but a necessity.

> A reference note is a single long-note containing brief citations or “references” to what caught your attention while reading a book, listening to a podcast, watching a video, or having a conversation.[15](private://read/01k5s99srw0kyxdyn4bmajfyp8/part0000_split_020.html#_idTextAnchor124) These long-notes are stored in your zettelkasten sometimes in a separate section or folder.[16](private://read/01k5s99srw0kyxdyn4bmajfyp8/part0000_split_020.html#_idTextAnchor125) A typical reference note looks like the one in Fig. 8.

> Luhmann didn’t embellish in his reference notes, nor does it appear he gave himself rules as to how many captures were too many. To continue reading and not have to stop to make main notes, Luhmann jotted down only a few words that would later jog his memory.[19](private://read/01k5s99srw0kyxdyn4bmajfyp8/part0000_split_020.html#_idTextAnchor128) These were not extensive summaries—just enough information to bring the idea back to the front of his mind.

> The easiest way to turn your journals into sources is to add unique identifiers. If you’re working with digital journals, add dates to both your file names and each day inside the file. I have a separate file for each year, with a running list of days starting with the most recent day at the top. Physical journals are handled in a similar way. Date each notebook or give it a volume number, then add dates and/or page numbers to the entries inside. Adding these unique identifiers makes it possible to create reference notes from your journals (Fig. 17).

> Using a zettelkasten to capture ideas conveyed through fiction is done in the same way you would any other work. But, fiction also makes it possible to engage with ideas in novel ways. Keep an eye out for character behaviors and traits, narrative arcs, scenes, and settings, all of which can be mined for insights. Even an author’s use of grammar (or lack thereof) and story-telling techniques (such as nonlinearity and disjunction), can be read as comments on social issues.

If the idea relates to another already networked in your slip box, either rewrite it to speak directly to the other idea, or reference the previously captured idea and state why you’re making the connection.

> The first thing to do when creating a main note from a reference note citation is to retype, copy/paste, or reference the quote you want to comment on in a new note. This serves two purposes:
> 1. It reminds you of where your idea came from.
> 2. It helps you decide whether your idea is restating the quote or if the idea was merely inspired by the quote. (This will determine if/how you cite the source in your writing).

> Regardless of which approach you take, keywords need not only speak to topics and themes. They could also point toward emotions and experiences. If you want to feel your way through your ideas, you might include indexed references to “Ideas that make me laugh” or “Ideas that make me want to change the world.” You might also include references to repeated situations in which certain ideas arise: “Ideas that arise in therapy,” or “Morning walking thoughts.” So long as your index helps you engage with your zettelkasten, it’s a functioning index.

> Things to Do
> 1. Consider what topics you regularly add notes to in your zettelkasten. Choose one and create a hub note for it.
> 2. Create a structure note to better organize your thinking on a topic developing in your zettelkasten. Explain how and why your ideas should be connected.
> 3. Play around with the two types of keyword indexes mentioned in this chapter. See how it feels to know what exactly is being dealt with versus wandering through your notes with only a rough idea of where you’ll end up.
> Things to Remember
> 1. A Luhmann-style zettelkasten is created bottom-up. It’s non-hierarchical and devoid of predefined categories and topical folders.
> 2. Higher level notes are both lenses and guides for viewing and engaging with the notes in your zettelkasten. They do not add structure to your collection of main notes.
> Things to Watch Out For
> 1. There’s no need to be overly comprehensive with what you include in your high-level views. Let yourself be surprised by what you encounter.

> The bottom half contains a record of the day’s activities, where I also capture any thoughts I had about what transpired. This style of recording and commenting is called “interstitial journaling,” a technique developed by Tony Stubblebine.[134](private://read/01k5s99srw0kyxdyn4bmajfyp8/part0000_split_020.html#_idTextAnchor243) The term “interstitial” refers to the space between things, in this case the space between transitioning from one task or project to another. In that space, Stubblebine suggests we record what we completed, what we thought about completing it, what we’re about to do, and what we think about doing it. According to Stubblebine, writing down what we’ve done and thoughts about what we’re doing next “empties our brain of the last project,” providing “space to formulate an optimal strategy for our next project.” It’s a way of letting the momentum of one cognitive cycle resolve, so you can begin another.[135](private://read/01k5s99srw0kyxdyn4bmajfyp8/part0000_split_020.html#_idTextAnchor244)

No answer is off limits. No reason too egoic. “Wanting to better understand my thinking” and “Wanting to better position myself as a thought leader” are both valid, and will inform how I write and frame the piece. Only if I struggle to put into words its benefit to others or its value to me, do I file the writing in a “Sleeping” folder, where it remains until its importance becomes more evident.
