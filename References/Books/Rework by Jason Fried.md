# Rework

## Highlights
### id946290075

> A lot of people say we can’t do what we do. They call us a fluke. They advise others to ignore our advice. Some have even called us irresponsible, reckless, and—gasp!—unprofessional.

> These critics don’t understand how a company can reject growth, meetings, budgets, boards of directors, advertising, salespeople, and “the real world,” yet thrive. That’s their problem, not ours. They say you need to sell to the Fortune 500. Screw that. We sell to the Fortune 5,000,000.

> Finally, it’s for all those people who’ve never considered going out on their own and starting a business. Maybe they don’t think they’re cut out for it. Maybe they don’t think they have the time, money, or conviction to see it through. Maybe they’re just afraid of putting themselves on the line. Or maybe they just think *business* is a dirty word. Whatever the reason, this book is for them, too.

### id946290173

> There’s a new reality. Today anyone can be in business. Tools that used to be out of reach are now easily accessible. Technology that cost thousands is now just a few bucks or even free. One person can do the job of two or three or, in some cases, an entire department. Stuff that was impossible just a few years ago is simple today.

> It’s time to rework work. Let’s get started.

> If other people can’t market their product, it has nothing to do with you. If other people can’t build a team, it has nothing to do with you. If other people can’t price their services properly, it has nothing to do with you. If other people can’t earn more than they spend … well, you get it.

- [n] Don't be so scared about failing because other people tell you that you will fail. They may even say it in the best of intentions. They want you to be "ready" because 9/10 businesses fail. But you don't have to measure yourself through the lenses of other people failure. You may just work on your own thing and make it work. First time. If other people can't market their product, it has nothing to do with you.

### id946290579

> Another common misconception: You need to learn from your mistakes. What do you really learn from mistakes? You might learn what *not* to do again, but how valuable is that? You still don’t know what you *should* do next.

### id946290581

> Contrast that with learning from your successes. Success gives you real ammunition. When something succeeds, you know what worked—and you can do it again. And the next time, you’ll probably do it even better.

- [n] This one and the previous paragraphs are pure gold. People fill their mouth full of "failure is the best teacher", but you only know what not to do again. Success is the biggest teacher. Because you learn what DOES work, and the next time you will do it even better.

> That shouldn’t be a surprise: It’s exactly how nature works. Evolution doesn’t linger on past failures, it’s always building upon what worked. So should you.

> **Planning is guessing**

- [n] This book is a gold-mine of contrarian takes and I fucking love it.

> Do we look at Harvard or Oxford and say, “If they’d only expand and branch out and hire thousands more professors and go global and open other campuses all over the world *… then* they’d be great schools.” Of course not. That’s not how we measure the value of these institutions. So why is it the way we measure businesses?

> Have you ever noticed that while small businesses wish they were bigger, big businesses dream about being more agile and flexible? And remember, once you get big, it’s really hard to shrink without firing people, damaging morale, and changing the entire way you do business.

> Don’t be insecure about aiming to be a small business. Anyone who runs a business that’s sustainable and profitable, whether it’s big or small, should be proud.
