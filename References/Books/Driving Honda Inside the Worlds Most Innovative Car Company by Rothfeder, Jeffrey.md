> And raised its share of questions. For one thing, what and where was Lincoln? Other automakers that had already set up shop in southern cities—among them Mercedes, Toyota, Nissan, and Hyundai—chose large towns like Smyrna, Tennessee; and in Alabama, Huntsville, Montgomery, and Tuscaloosa. The companies wanted to be in cosmopolitan areas where the pool of potential workers who had experience with new manufacturing technologies and skill sets was sufficiently large.

> Honda, on the other hand, picked Lincoln precisely because it offered what the company wanted most: anonymity and no big-city spotlights or distractions. Indeed, during the search process for a property in Alabama, Honda executives rejected Birmingham, the first option presented to them, saying it was too big and crowded and, well, messy. And they told the state’s industrial development officials that they wanted a site at which they could work unobserved and inconspicuously.
> By those criteria, Lincoln was perfect. Before Honda arrived it was a sleepy flatland, left behind years earlier by farmers and defense factories, barely a pit stop on east–west I-20 between Birmingham and Atlanta.

> As Mayor Watson said later, with an impish grin and a syrupy drawl, “It was as if we won the lottery; in our wildest dreams, no one ever expected Lincoln to be in newspapers as far away as California or Tokyo.” (That was the same conversation in which he pointedly took pains to erase any misconceptions I had about the origin of his town’s name: virtually all southern cities named Lincoln, he said, are honoring Benjamin, the aide-de-camp to George Washington who accepted British general Charles Cornwallis’s surrender at Yorktown, and not Abraham.)

They don’t teach you step-by-step; they just throw you into the pool and let you figure it out on your own. If you don’t know how to swim at first, you need to be aggressive to survive. We are to try out whatever we think is necessary to take ourselves to the next level.”

> There’s almost nothing about Honda’s unorthodox DNA that hasn’t been informed by the skepticism and curiosity—by the unpacking and then reassembling of knowledge and information—that characterizes the best of the engineering discipline. However, there is a downside to this: engineer CEOs are not, generally, inspiring or motivating public speakers. That’s where having a more traditional sales or marketing background, in which communication skills are necessarily honed to try to persuade people to buy your product, is a distinct advantage.

> With that and a few more words, the breaking of the ground was about to begin. A Honda public relations person took to the microphone to tell the luminaries on the stage to step down and pick up a shovel.
> “Now, you may have noticed that everyone isn’t using a shovel,” he continued. “Well, Mr. Yoshino spoke earlier about the concept of ‘Powered by Honda.’ The tiller that he and Mayor Watson are using to break ground is one of those ‘Powered by Honda’ products. I want you to count down with me to the ground breaking. . . . Count down to this start-up of construction for Honda’s new facility in Alabama.
> “Five-four-three-two-one. Gentlemen—start your engine . . . and shovels.”
> The shovels were not the problem. The tiller, however, was. It wouldn’t kick over. Yoshino first pulled the starter string smoothly and confidently, no response. Again, with a smile, dead. Then he yanked on it hard—there was sweat appearing on his brow and upper lip—just a cough from the machine. Now getting more nervous, Yoshino jerked on the rope with force, so hard that someone said it looked like he was going to strain a muscle. It didn’t help. People in the audience were growing more and more embarrassed for the CEO and by the obvious irony of a dead Honda engine dedicating the company’s crown jewel greenfield factory; they wanted to look away or whispered to their neighbor about how they wished they were anyplace else but here.
> Then, something unexpected happened. Rather than give up or call for help from the Honda maintenance crew in the crowd, Yoshino tackled the balky tiller himself. More comfortable with technical complications than audiences anyway, he bent down and peered into the engine, casually playing with the spark plugs, the carburetor, the gas line. He flipped the choke. It took less than two minutes; then he stood up and pulled the cord. The engine came alive.

Quite to the contrary, Honda-san would have been proud for this reason: though unfortunate, the mishap with the tiller revealed yet again that Honda Motor, the company Soichiro founded some fifty years earlier, is an awkward outfit built on paradox and contradiction, full of enthusiasm and warts, yet wholly original, influential, creative, enterprising, resourceful, and successful—just as he was.

To him, it was the fear of failure that drove people to achieve the most, rather than failure itself.

> Fujisawa was adept at shogi, a Japanese version of chess with at least one substantial variation: when you captured an opposing player’s piece, it could be redeployed on your side. To Fujisawa that was an apt metaphor for business strategy. As he saw it, by outsmarting the competition, you not only vanquish a rival, you are enhanced by his losses. And the only way to avoid being beaten yourself is by constantly being on alert and ready to respond to the errors in judgment and in practice that could give your competitors an opening.

They’re nimble and smart. To use a basketball term, they can go small or go big with equal skill.”

### id950343014

> Among Honda’s striking achievements:
> • Founded in 1949, Honda is the youngest and most versatile automotive manufacturer in the world. The company designed and built its first car in 1963, the S500 roadster, some sixty years after Henry Ford’s Model A debuted. Now, Honda employs 140,000 people globally to make a panoply of products: cars, trucks, vans, SUVs, motorcycles, lawn mowers, snowblowers, and other power equipment.
> • By a large margin, Honda is the preeminent engine maker in the world with an output of more than 20 million internal combustion motors annually.
> • Honda has never posted a loss in its history. Its automobile operating profit ratios of about 5 percent consistently top the industry.
> • Honda’s stock price has nearly doubled since September 2008, when the global economy collapsed, and at the beginning of January 2014 stood at record territory of about 40. In that five-year period, Ford and GM (which had its postbankruptcy IPO in 2010) have been relatively flat. A dollar invested in Honda U.S. ADRs (American depositary receipts) when initially issued in 1987 would be worth $800 at the beginning of 2014; the same amount invested in Ford would have returned only about $100. Since Toyota’s U.S. ADR was issued in the 1990s, its shares are up 300 percent, while Honda’s are up nearly 600 percent. Moreover, Honda’s market capitalization of about $73 billion is well above Ford’s and GM’s.
> • Honda automobiles rank high in sales in virtually every international market. In the United States, for example, the Accord, Civic, CR-V, and Odyssey are the number-one models (excluding fleet sales to rental companies, corporations, and government agencies) in the midsize, compact, compact SUV, and minivan sectors, respectively.
> • Honda vehicles are the most durable and longest lasting of any automaker, with 75 percent of its cars and trucks sold in the last twenty-five years still on the road, according to registration data from industry analysts Polk.
> • Within ten years of Honda’s founding in a country whose economy was drained by war, political upheaval, and dozens of failures of major companies and banks, it had become the number-one motorcycle outfit in the world, besting more than two hundred competitors. Honda sells about 15 million motorcycles a year; the second-place company, Yamaha, produces only about 5 million motorcycles annually while Harley-Davidson struggles to reach 500,000.
> • In 1974, about three years after entering the U.S. car market, Honda stunned the American auto industry by introducing a four-door Civic that met stringent Clean Air Act emissions standards, which called for a 90 percent decrease in carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, and nitrogen oxide levels by 1975 compared with 1970 vehicles. This was the first car in the world to qualify under the new rules and it hit the streets just as the large U.S. automakers and Toyota were lobbying Washington to soften these requirements, claiming it was impossible to economically produce an engine that accomplished the act’s goals.
> • After trumping its rivals by becoming the first Japanese company to manufacture cars in the United States in 1982, Honda again outpaced its domestic competitors by introducing a luxury brand, the Acura, in 1986. Toyota’s Lexus would not emerge for another three years. In addition, Honda built the first electric/gas hybrid, the Insight, in 1999, and the first fuel cell–powered vehicle, the FCX Clarity, in 2002. Indeed, Honda’s research and development arm, whose mission is broadly to study human mobility, has designed a robot, named ASIMO (Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility), that can climb stairs, run, and follow oral directions; a computerized leg harness that assists people who have difficulty walking by supporting their strides in response to information obtained from hip sensors; and a new lightweight private jet, made entirely of composite materials with unique design elements, including laminar flow body, an exaggerated, tapered nose, and engines mounted over the wing, that reduce drag substantially. As a percentage of revenue, Honda earmarks more money for R&D than any other automaker.
> • In terms of industrial performance, Honda surpasses the rest of the auto sector in almost every meaningful benchmark: factory utilization is routinely above 90 percent; production hours per car is in the teens; no automaker can make as many different vehicles on the same assembly line with virtually no turnaround time between models as Honda (this is known as Honda’s flexible manufacturing system); and compared with its rivals, Honda plants produce more cars per square foot and are typically the least expensive to build.

> When the Japanese automakers—principally Toyota, Honda, Nissan, and Mazda—began selling cars in volume in the United States in the 1970s, they brought with them an operating philosophy that American companies found to be odd and of questionable value: lean manufacturing.

> Toyota, the least shy among the Japanese automakers, took full advantage of the budding interest in Japanese manufacturing methods, opening its kimono to numerous Western academics and think tanks—and subsequently enjoying the acclaim (and increased sales) from being the subject of a bestselling book that introduced the intimate details of lean manufacturing to the West, The Machine That Changed the World, by MIT professors James Womack, Daniel Jones, and Daniel Roos. The Toyota Production System, or TPS, and Toyota itself had become the new high bars for manufacturing in the post-Ford age. Indeed, by the late 1990s, even the Big 3 U.S. automakers had overcome their resistance to “lean” and actively, if unsuccessfully, tried to implement it in their factories.

### id950345060

> But as the authors of The Machine That Changed the World put it, the greatest distinction between lean manufacturing and mass production can be found in their objectives: “Mass producers set a limited goal—‘good enough,’ which translates into an acceptable number of defects, a maximum acceptable level of inventories, a narrow range of standardized products. . . . Lean producers, on the other hand, set their sights explicitly on perfection: continually declining costs, zero defects, zero inventories and endless product variety.”

### id950345182

> Because Toyota appeared to be radically different from every manufacturer that Westerners had known before, and outwardly at least one of Toyota’s most distinctive characteristics was its production system, lean manufacturing was confused with Toyota’s corporate culture. It was assumed to be the reason for Toyota’s success, the genetic code of the organization, rather than the tool Toyota used to be successful. To a great extent, even Toyota was fooled by this. Viewed through this blinkered lens, lean manufacturing became known as an operational strategy when in actuality it is a set of tactics.

> However, recently at Toyota, we had the opportunity to observe how ineffective even the most intelligently orchestrated lean methods could be when a company’s operational culture abandoned them. As Toyota’s growth exploded through the 1990s and into the 2000s, instead of an obsessive focus on preserving and enhancing lean techniques at all of the company’s factories and on training the next generation of lean gurus who would teach others out in the field, management’s attention had shifted to other priorities: for one, to overtake General Motors as the top-selling auto company in the world, and for another, to expand globally at an increasingly rapid pace. That meant producing more cars, new designs, and customized models than at any other time in the company’s history.

> With its altered agenda, Toyota had become much more ordinary, closer to being just another automaker. Its production system was still lean, but its culture and strategic direction were tilted toward escalating sales growth, a hyperactive set of goals that were not aligned anymore with its manufacturing approach. On the factory floor, critical lean concepts, such as a strong emphasis on quality control throughout the assembly process, were still practiced, but Toyota’s management in Japan gave lean outcomes short shrift. And before long, this neglect from headquarters served to attenuate lean efforts at Toyota operations around the world.

### id950345304

> The disconnect within Toyota finally became public in 2009–10 when Toyota recalled more than 15 million vehicles globally, the largest extended recall ever. Although these repairs covered everything from faulty spare tire carriers to oil hose leaks to fuel pump problems in all types of models, the most prominent malfunction involved unintended acceleration—the car takes off, or feels like it is about to, even when braking.

### id950345938

> Toyota management conceded that internal dysfunction led directly to these quality problems. “Toyota has, for the past few years, been expanding its business rapidly,” Akio Toyoda, the company’s CEO, said. “Quite frankly, I fear the pace at which we have grown may have been too quick.” He added that the company’s priorities “became confused, and we were not able to stop, think, and make improvements as much as we were able to before.”

### id950346000

> A group of Toyota workers in the United States told me that the real failure in the unintended acceleration episode was not that Toyota quality control workers did not know about it soon enough but rather that their attempts to notify higher-ups about the problem were thwarted. Indeed they had heard complaints from U.S. drivers in the months leading up to the recall, but no one would listen. In theory, this shouldn’t happen in a lean environment where workers are expected to go as far as stopping the assembly line when something is amiss and offer possible solutions to issues that threaten the quality of the product, to take control of their jobs and responsibility for the items that they build. “When we mentioned that something was wrong with the gas pedals—and as people started complaining about them—one supervisor told us, ‘Let’s just ride this out; Japan doesn’t want to hear this. Let’s not raise too much of a fuss right now,’” one of the workers said.

> Those savings and more have been frittered away by Toyota’s foot-dragging on the balky gas pedal issue. Because Toyota failed to report internal knowledge about acceleration problems in its vehicles in a timely fashion, the automaker has paid upward of $70 million in fines to the U.S. government. And in March 2014, Toyota settled a Justice Department criminal investigation into its activities for $1.2 billion, the largest penalty of its kind ever imposed on an auto company.

> Although Honda never made the miscalculation that culture could be subordinate to the tools and techniques used by the organization, the company is nonetheless often misguidedly characterized as being similar to Toyota in its operating principles. In large part that is because like Toyota, Honda is fanatical about lean precepts such as reduction of waste, efficient and ergonomically sound factory floors, just-in-time parts logistics, and minimization of product defects. However, those facets of plant excellence are assumed by Honda to be the price to participate at the superior level the Japanese companies have chosen for making cars; they are the obvious prerequisites of being a first-class manufacturer—but they are not Honda’s identity.

> “At Honda a few years later I had to oversee the setting up of the line at the Lincoln engine plant. The experience was so different. The only instruction I got was, ‘Go to the Anna engine plant in Ohio, study how they do it, talk to the workers and the managers about what they like and don’t like, what they would fix and what they would leave unchanged, and then make a better one in Lincoln.’ I took this to mean, understand what they’ve done, and then advance it.”

Equally troubling, multinationals discovered that products made in an Asian country could be literally lost at sea for weeks during shipments to the West, leaving the company uncertain about when and in what shape the items would arrive. If the wrong goods were shipped, which happens all too frequently, the company could face millions of dollars in mislaid inventory.

> Born in 1906 in a tiny hamlet outside of Hamamatsu, in Shizuoka Prefecture, about two hours south of Tokyo on the Pacific coast, Soichiro Honda’s first real brush with mechanical novelty came in the 1910s when a Ford Model T drove down the dirt roads of his village. Honda’s father, Gihei, was a blacksmith who also fixed bicycles. Intrigued by his father’s dexterity and the tools he had to work with, Soichiro repaired bikes as well but didn’t find them particularly challenging. He was fascinated by the mechanics of mobility, but the way bicycles worked was too pedestrian.

> “I was enchanted by the smell of that oil. I leaned over a spot of oil on the ground and put my nose right up to it, and rubbed my hands in the residue. From that moment on, I only had one fixed idea, and that was to invent machines and to get greasy with machine oil and lubricant.”

Whenever he could, he traveled with his grandfather to examine the inner workings of a nearby rice-polishing mill, which had one of the few mechanical engines in his remote area.
> “The sound of the machine was my first music,” Honda recalled. “From the veranda of our wooden house, I could see the blue smoke it emitted. Going to the mill became a habit. I loved the noise of the combustion motors, the smoke . . . and I stayed there for hours, watching the machine while my grandfather tried to talk me into going back.”

> Art Shokai’s owner was impressed by Honda’s innate technical expertise, but at that time well-traveled craftsmen still held sway over the tiny global auto industry; as the old-timers saw it then, it should take years of watching and training before an individual was given his own set of tools to work on a car.

And he planned his next auto industry triumph. This time, piston rings.
> Still among the most elaborate parts of an engine, piston rings failed often in the early days of internal combustion motors. Their main task is to close the gap between the piston and the cylinder during the compression cycle, sealing gases and oil in the combustion chamber. Piston ring gap tolerances are minuscule—as little as a thousandth of an inch—and must be machined perfectly or the engine could seize up.

Soichiro realized that he didn’t know enough about metallurgy to be able to determine how specific metals would react in the manufacturing process, and thus, he didn’t have enough basic information to control the quality of his products. To fill this hole in his knowledge, at age thirty, he enrolled at the Hamamatsu School of Technology and took on a full schedule of courses involving steelmaking, machining techniques, stamping, tool-making dies, and manufacturing parts from designs. He went to classes diligently, but was expelled at the end of his second year for ignoring his exams. Nonetheless, Soichiro continued to go to school at Hamamatsu, sitting in on classes.

Unlike other motorcycle makers in the United States and parts of Europe, Honda Motor did not have money to spare. Its financial backing was limited and Japanese consumers were compelled by events to be penurious. Yet Soichiro adopted an assembly technique for the company’s factory that was more typically used by large manufacturers—including some of the automobile makers—although none of the top U.S. and European motorcycle companies were yet among them: he chose die casting rather than sand casting for constructing engines as well as components like tie rods, crankcases, and valve seats.

> Simply put, in die casting, which is commonplace today in manufacturing, molten metal is squeezed under high pressure into so-called dies (similar to molds) that have been machined into a certain shape—for example, an engine block with cylinder holes. Dies can be reused repeatedly, literally from one moment to the next.
> Sand casting, by contrast, involves pouring sand and then a hot metal, such as aluminum, over a mold (often made of plastic) in a large plate. The combined sand and metal mixture adheres to the mold, producing the finished product. Because molds, unlike dies, can only be used once, sand-casted items are built individually, although now automated equipment can speed up the process. And the excess sand and metal must be thrown away as waste.

One die fabricator told Honda’s brother-in-law Takeo Isobe, who worked at the firm, that it would cost as much as 500,000 yen to produce each die. That was well beyond the company’s budget. So Honda asked his employees to make the dies themselves by hand.

The problem was that in order to stay in first gear, you had to keep your foot pressed down on the change pedal. If you were going up a long uphill road, for example, your toes would get tired. That was why the sales suddenly dropped. We just got too far ahead of ourselves with the idea of what would be good for the customer. Coming on top of the economic slowdown, this was real trouble.”

Takeshima contacted Fujisawa, suggesting that he meet with Soichiro Honda. He told Fujisawa that Soichiro, with whom Takeshima kept in touch from time to time, was a gifted and creative engineer. The unique features on the bikes he had made—the breakthroughs in engine design and frame design—and the patents he held, as well as his manufacturing acumen, attested to that.

The logic behind the uniforms is that they eliminate rank; in the moment-to-moment give-and-take of their daily responsibilities, each Honda worker’s point of view or suggestion is equal.

> A serious crisis on the plant floor spurred this spontaneous meeting. A supplier had sent the Anna team dozens of faulty camshafts, a critical part that manages the flow of air and gasoline entering the engine’s cylinders. Because of a hairline defect in the way the camshaft was seated, a faint, rhythmic chirping sound could be heard in the Honda motors that contained these components.

> Because of the tight conditions under the hood, it appeared that it would be impossible to try to remove the defective camshafts without taking the engines out as well.

> The meeting seemed to be winding down when an assembler suggested a way to replace the camshafts without removing the engine completely and virtually rebuilding the guts of the car: through an overhead pulley system that would lift the motor just enough out of the Accord to give the workers sufficient room to maneuver.
> “It’s not worth it,” one of his colleagues responded. “That’s more work than just doing the repairs. Let’s just give up and do it the obvious way.”

> Dentinger said that he recalled this story so vividly because it was one of the seemingly fruitless moments at Honda when you wish the corporate culture were more like those at most other companies—that is, less sensitive about employees and their ideas and more top-down, letting supervisors’ stances carry more weight in the discussion phase than, say, an assembly worker’s.

If we don’t include our associates in the decision making, we’re ignoring potentially our most valuable asset.”

> The meetings are called waigaya, which isn’t a word in Japanese or any other language, but rather a name given them by Honda Motor cofounder Takeo Fujisawa (at least according to company lore). He chose waigaya because to him the three syllables sounded like babble, the jabber of many people talking at the same time—wai-ga-ya, wai-ga-ya, wai-ga-ya; in English, it could be hubbub. It is the noise of heated discussion and the free flow of ideas; it represents a battleground of subjective and objective opinions, of chaotic communication, open disagreement, and inharmonious decision making.

> the central tenets of Honda Motor’s waigaya can best be explained by four very straightforward rules:
> 1. Everybody is equal in waigaya—there are no bad ideas except those that are not aired.
> 2. All ideas must be disputed and rejected until they are either proven valid or vanquished.
> 4. When a person shares an idea, he or she doesn’t own it anymore—it belongs to Honda and the group can do with it what it will.
> 5. At the end of waigaya, decisions and responsibilities are generated—a precise list of who is to do what next and by when.
> As one Honda executive put it: “Waigaya to me means perpetual dissatisfaction. At our company, self-satisfaction is the enemy.”

> When you ask people at Honda about their most memorable waigaya, individual dramatic incidents like the way the faulty Acura camshafts were replaced in Anna or the iconic TL tires were agreed upon are often recalled. After all, these were explicit, identifiable moments when out of the ashes of desultory discussion—blah, blah, blah, waigaya, waigaya, waigaya—something truly useful emerged; a simple, quiet idea was thus hatched out of noise.

> In fact, many of Honda’s most significant manufacturing improvements have been the result of waigaya lasting a year or even years, held each day, sometimes for five minutes if the discussion lacks spark and other times for an hour or more when a robust argument ensues. In those cases, breakthroughs may be infrequent but they inevitably happen. For example, at the Marysville, Ohio, factory, a daily waigaya, which took more than twenty-four months to complete, drove a quality control effort that increased the factory’s “direct pass” output—the percentage of cars leaving the assembly line without any defects—to 95 percent from about 70 percent. (The direct pass in most auto factories industry-wide is actually well under 70 percent.)

> The waigaya wended from identifying seven key attributes of Honda’s culture that all plant workers must embrace—among them, teamwork, questioning extant processes, finding solutions even before problems arise, individual leadership no matter what job you hold, and taking personal responsibility for the company’s success—to concluding that many employees had become myopic, viewing their small part of the manufacturing operation through the tiniest, most opaque lens. To change this attitude, a portion of the waigaya addressed working conditions and job descriptions for each position in the factory. It’s important to note that while some statistics were used in this analysis, the discussions were predominantly anecdotal, showing a critical bias in waigaya for visceral responses to conditions rather than data-driven assumptions.

> Instead, emerging from the stories told during the waigaya was the uncomfortable revelation that few employees in the Ohio factory knew or cared much about what their colleagues did up or down the assembly line. Worse yet, they criticized mistakes made in other departments and showed no inclination to help find solutions. These sentiments were unusual for Honda Motor, so antithetical and indifferent to the company’s kinetic, participatory culture that it took the top brass at Marysville aback.

> As a remedy, employees—some of whom had worked at their current positions for two decades—were given new assignments in parts of the factory they had little knowledge of. Welders moved to assembly, assemblers to paint, and painters to weld. Quality control experts were sprinkled throughout the assembly line. And on-the-floor training emphasized to employees in new roles that they should attempt to understand how the job has usually been done while thinking of ways to do it better, particularly to collaborate with other parts of the assembly line more effectively.

> “By doing this, we were able to innovate our thinking,” said Rob May, a twenty-seven-year veteran of Marysville, who at the time of the marathon waigaya was a manager of the assembly department. “I think we all get wrapped up in being one-dimensional and seeing everything from one perspective, and we left people in positions, quite honestly, probably too long. That was a significant change, in just being able to understand that the way I’ve been thinking is very one-sided. I need to be part of the solution, not just point the finger and push it off on someone else.”

They think more in terms of strategic accommodation or adaptive persistence, underscoring their belief that corporate direction evolves from an adjustment to unfolding events.”
