> Tagline:
> Your tagline is often a make-or-break moment.
> The goal of the tagline is three-fold:
> - Tell people who you are 
> - Tell people what you're working on 
> - Tell people what they should expect if they follow you
> It's not time to be cute or clever.
> It's time to be clear.

> - What are your customers saying about your business? 
> - What awards have you won?
> Don't be shy. 
> Show off.

> Write High-Performance Content:
> High-performance LinkedIn content has 3 different parts:
> - The Meat 
> - The Trailer 
> - The takeaway & CTC
> I use this to write a piece of content each morning at 8:15a EST.
> Here's how it works ↓

> The Meat:
> The first thing I do is create "the meat" of the content.
> This is where you’re teaching something.
> It’s the information you want to convey.
> In this example, I am teaching 10 steps that help build your first side hustle:

> The Trailer:
> The next part of the content I create is the "trailer."
> The trailer is the opener and has 2 jobs:
> - Break the scroll pattern with the first line. 
> - Make each line intriguing enough to get the reader to the next.
> Here's the trailer for that piece of content.

> The Takeaway & CTC:
> My goal at the end is to give the reader a nice little takeaway.
> Think of it as the last thing they'll remember reading before I call them to the conversation with a simple question.
> Like this:

> Recycle for 2x Engagement:
> After 4 years, I have over 2,000 pieces of unique content.
> So, for my 2nd post (1p EST), I recycle.
> I go back 365 days and update a piece of content from last year.
> There are 100k+ new followers who never saw it.
> And most people won't remember.
> * * *
> Interact With Top Creators:
> When I was getting started, I wanted to build a high-quality network.
> Here's how:
> 1. Shared a resource 
> 2. Engaged with their content 
> 3. Featured them in my newsletter 
> 4. Praised something specific they did 
> 5. Introduced them to someone meaningful
> * * *
> Leverage Little-Known Features:
> Here are a few little-known features you can use to grow:
> 1. Profile URL link 
> 2. Carousel posts 
> 3. Notification bell 
> 4. LinkedIn Newsletter
> * * *
> Profile URL Link:
> I drive at least 100 people to my website each day via the new LinkedIn profile URL.
> You simply edit your profile, scroll to the bottom and add a link.
> Similar to a link in your Twitter bio, but can be edited to display as a CTA.

> Carousel Posts:
> Last year, LinkedIn officially rolled out their carousel beta and people are taking advantage of them.
> Just create a 4X5 inch Canva PDF and upload it.
> Easy win.

> Notification Bell:
> It used to be that LinkedIn didn't have a notification bell, like Twitter.
> That changed a few months ago.
> Now, you can set it up to receive notifications for when your favorite creators drop new content.
> ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FnZr4bMWIAEH1ZP.jpg)
> * * *
> LinkedIn Newsletter:
> You can apply for, and get a LinkedIn newsletter easily.
> When you launch your newsletter's first issue, LinkedIn will promote it to all of your followers.
> That's why it's good to get 10k to 15k followers first, then launch.

> Funnel People To Your Website:
> There's a workaround for linking out on LinkedIn.
> Write a good long-form piece of content, and add a link at the bottom.
> Close out the "preview" image and then post.
> 30% reduction in impressions doesn't matter when your CTR is improved 6x.
