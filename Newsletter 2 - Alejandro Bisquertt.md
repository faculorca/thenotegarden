**Subject line:** The reality of biotech fundraising no one tells you

---

90% of startups eventually fail. Biotech is no exception.

When I started in this industry 10 years ago, no one warned me how brutal raising capital in biotech really is. I thought with good science and a decent pitch I'd close my round in a few months. Reality was very different.

After pitching to over 100 investors, founding three biotech companies (two failed), and raising millions, I learned some truths I wish someone had told me earlier.

Today I'm going to share the 4 realities of biotech fundraising that no one tells you, and what to do about them.

Let's go.

### 1. You're going to pitch way more than you think

I once heard that you should pitch to about 100 investors to raise your first $100K. 

And yeah, I can confirm.

I had an excel sheet of hoy many investors I pitched to. I think it was over 100. I remember events in San Francisco and Boston where in a single day you could pitch 20 or 30 different people. It's a brutal game. The odds are against you.

This means that sometimes the CEO has to be in the lab running experiments at the same time is managing the fundraising.

And this has practical implications: if your CEO is in the lab running experiments (which is common in biotech), a 6 to 9 month fundraising process means your R&D stops. It's a brutal trade-off that simply doesn't exist in software.

### Reality 2: You can't show traction like an app

When you pitch in biotech there's a massive difference from software: generally, you can't have sales that early.

Sales take time, there are regulatory processes, or the product simply isn't ready. So showing cash flows isn't straightforward. Company traction can't be measure with revenue, so investors have to trust technical and regulatory milestones.

When investors have biotech experience, they know and understand this. But many times you're pitching to an investor who's expecting to see traction like you're an app (active users, growing MRR). Under those expectations, it's very hard to deliver.

The other thing that happens is that scientists obsess over the technology. And the reality is most investors assume your tech works. What they want to see is the business model, the market, the team. I lost a lot of meetings explaining the science when I should have been explaining how I was going to make money.

### Reality 3: Your iteration speed is brutally slow

This is maybe the most important point I'd give any biotech founder.

In my first company, Neurognos (we made a diagnostic test for Alzheimer's), from the time I had a hypothesis, got the funding, waited for reagents to arrive, ran an experiment, and learned something. It could take six months to a year. Iteration was incredibly slow.

In contrast, at Codebreaker, with my first client I screwed up and it didn't go so well. With the second client I fixed things, and the third was better. And when you look at what we have today, it's the result of multiple iterations, way better than what we started with.

The ability to prototype fast and iterate to figure out where the hell the ball is going is massive advice. Because when you start, you have no idea if the thing is going to work. You have a hypothesis, and you can test it. That whole "build an MVP and test it fast" thing is hard in biotech, but there are ways to do it. Find those ways.

### Reality 4: The perfect pitch doesn't exist, only practice does

When it comes to the pitch, I think the most important thing is using the classic structure of problem, solution, traction, and team. 

The classic 12 slides from Y Combinator work.

But what makes the difference is being able to mix that with a narrative, a story of some sort. Something entertaining, something that moves people, that has engagement, a story, suspense. Classic stuff from theater or persuasion.

Which is really hard to do. 

Some people are naturals, like they were born to tell stories. Not for me though. For me, it's pure practice.

If you've seen the movie Whiplash: "Not quite my tempo." And the teacher makes him practice and practice and practice to a level of obsession. I'm more that style. There's no shortcuts, sheer volume and reps.

### What no one tells you in the end

To be honest, after almost 10 years doing this, the truth is my fundraising numbers are small considering how long I've been in the industry. At Neurognos I raised about $1M and at Codebreaker I also raised about $1M between private and public funding.

But several of my businesses were relatively profitable. So I didn't always raise, and that's also valid.

Fundraising in biotech is a game of patience, resilience, and accepting that the odds are against you. But if you can push for iterating as fast as possible, showing clear milestones and practicing your pitch over and over, your odds are a lot better.

And if after reading this you still want to start a biotech company, welcome to the club.

See you next week.
