I’ve been stuck in the first for a while.

One year on social media. Writing and obsessing over learning persuasion, digital writing, using templates and prompts, the power of hooks. Basically optimizing how to say things.

The result is 30 subscribers and never crossing the 100 follows barrier on twitter.

10 of my subs are friends and family.

Everyone is always telling you that consistency compound, that you need to show up and be useful. That’s the key for growth.

And that is absolutely true, but there’s another true behind it:

**You need to do cool shit to share cool shit.**

Yes, building a digital business by creating content and writing online is possible. Absolutely. There’s so much people who’ve done super well by doing so. But almost all of them have done cool shit before writing and sharing online.

The best videos out there are stories about someone doing something cool. If you don’t believe me, go to your favorite folder on YouTube, Instagram or Tik-Tok and take a look.

So, I’ve been thinking on letting go of the need of publishing and teaching every single week about something I think other people would like to learn. And start putting effort on doing cool stuff.

And this week I did something kinda cool. Well, we did.

My friend came to my place and for some reason we ended up taking a dusted Celeron laptop I had in a closet and self-host the Minecraft server I’ve been paying for a while.

It was something simple, but it brought a feeling I haven’t had in a while. I felt the wonder, the spark of discovery.

I felt like a kid.

That feeling of breaking things, figuring out, hitting a wall and doing it with friends. No absurd metrics. No “will this get traction?”. It was a moment when we just followed our curiosity.

It was the most fun I’d had in months. And I wasn’t trying to document it. I wasn’t thinking about hooks and how to turn it into content (although I’m doing it right now, lol).

But I was just... doing something interesting.

And the Minecraft server pulled me into a rabbit hole I didn’t know existed.

Homelabs. Self-hosting. People running their own servers, storing their own data, building their own infrastructure instead of falling into the not-so-private big tech ecosystem.

And I must say, I love the philosophy of owning your information, notes and thoughts. Because I don’t trust corporations to hold the keys to my digital existence, and I’m sick of them forcing us into software and bloatware we don’t need.

Some people say 2026 is the year of Linux (and it’s not a joke anymore!!) It took 20 years for Linux to reach 1% market share, 10 years to reach 2%, then 2.2 years for 3% in June 2023 and this year 5%. This means that more and more people are interested in privacy and **_not wanting to see ads and AI everywhere lol._**

I am not a coder, a game dev or have anything to do with code more than a few scripts I did in uni. But going into this rabbit hole changed a lot how I see things.

And this idea of ownership goes to this writing space too.

I’d been renting my creative identity from platform dynamics. Letting subscriber counts tell me if my work mattered. Asking the algorithm what I should care about. I even paid for a few digital courses (more money that I’d like to admit).

But maybe to build an audience of people that actually care, you have to actually care. Exploring your curiosity towards things you really care about, and not because “it would make for good content.”

The growth focused people talk constantly about finding your niche, studying what works, create content consistently, optimize until the numbers move. And I’m not gonna lie, this works for the people that are clear on what they want. But it’s useless when you’re twenty something and are barely understanding life.

So, do something genuinely interesting first. Get curious. Build weird projects with friends. Fall into rabbit holes that have nothing to do with your “brand.”

Content can be a byproduct of a life worth documenting.

If you don’t think what you’re doing is interesting, why others would think otherwise. You can’t polish nothing into something. The hooks don’t matter if there’s nothing underneath.

But if you follow your curiosity and explore things that light you up, the content writes itself. Suddenly you have too much to say and the problem is capturing and editing it, not generating it.

So, I’m done obsessing on how to grow and what I’m doing wrong.

From now on, I’m trying to focus on living an interesting life instead of obsessing over content.

And things like the server, the homelab rabbit hole and the philosophy of digital sovereignty triggers my curiosity and sense of exploration.

So, that’s where I’m going (at least for now). Not because it’s optimized or may become a trend tbh. Because it is actually interesting to me.

And content will follow.

Or maybe not.

But at least I’ll be doing something worth doing either way.

Do interesting things.

That’s my super bad growth hack that maybe works.

Thank you for reading,
