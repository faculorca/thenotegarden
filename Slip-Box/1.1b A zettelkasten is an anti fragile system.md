Anti fragile systems, as described in [[1.1 An anti-fragile system is able to grow from chaos]], are systems that benefit from chaos.

Zettelkastens are intrinsically chaotic systems. You don’t write notes in a linear approach, so the train of thought reflects on a bunch of interconnected notes and ideas instead of a regular long note.

This creates chaos, entropy. Particles are moving faster inside of the vessel and are forced to link and generate compound.
