# 3.1c1a1 My first message on LinkedIn

Tomorrow it’s been a year since I started posting on X/Twitter. Yes, It has been an interesting experience and I’ve learned a fucking ton. But I think I can leverage the power of LinkedIn to become effectively turn this into a business.

As I just graduated, that is my hook. This message will be the last one I write in spanish.
