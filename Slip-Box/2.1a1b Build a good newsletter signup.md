# 2.1a1b Build a good newsletter signup

![[2.1a1b Build a good newsletter signup.png|This is a bad signup]]

Subscribe is a task, you want that out. And “our”? you’re not them.

Turn the title into something outcome orientated like:

“Build an your Social Zettelkasten”

Also, instead of shouting “Subscribe now!” in the button, change it to the benefit of your newsletter.
