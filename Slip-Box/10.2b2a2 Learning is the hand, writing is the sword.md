# 10.2b2a2 Learning is the hand, writing is the sword

One of the best ways to learn anything is by writing.

You can write by hand or type on a keyboard, It doesn’t matter as you are the one to come up with the words. ([[10.2b2a2a If you write to learn, use your own words|10.2b2a2a]])

When you write anything, you are forced to put your own thoughts and understanding into a string of characters. And not in a random way.

This is the key to understanding and learning. And even more if you apply the principles of the Feynmann Technique ([[10.2b2a2b Use the Feynmann technique to learn and teach|10.2b2a2b]])

Be simple, be blunt and be clear.

You can’t write clear if you don’t think clear.

Force yourself to think clearly by writing clearly.

*I’m pretty sure here can go a good quote of Jordan B. Peterson*
