Some of us are experts in rationalizing everything and putting logic over feeling.

The world is full of noise. We consume more information in a day than Charles Darwin probably did in his whole life.

Our brains are not made for that amount of data.

Generate your own data by living and experimenting instead.

And trust your gut in what feels right and what feels wrong. It will lead to mistakes? Of course, so do logic. You might as well try what feels like the right thing to do.
