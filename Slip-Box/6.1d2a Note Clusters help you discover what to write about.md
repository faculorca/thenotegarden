# 6.1d2a Note Clusters help you discover what to write about

As you take notes and highlight stuff in books, articles and videos, you’ll tend towards specific topics you like.

Building up a volume of notes and highlights often leads to certain topics you write more than others. Sönke Ahrens calls this “clusters”.

They will form naturally towards your topics of interest.

The amazing thing about clusters is that they can tell you what to write about when you don’t know it yet.

In my case, In the last months I’ve been writing about zettelkastens and writing systems a lot. So that is the biggest cluster that is forming in my notes.

The great thing about obsidian is the graph view, which can show you VISUALLY the clusters forming from your thought patters.
