The **Illusion of Competence,** also known as the Dunning-Kruger effect, is a cognitive bias where the person believes that he/she can perform at a higher level that he/she really can. 

It's basically the reverse of the **Impostor Syndrome** (see also: [[Overcome Impostor Syndrome]]).

The explanation for the effect is that when we are not good at a task, we don't know enough to accurately asses our ability. So inexperience generates the illusion of expertise. There are known-knowns and unknown unknowns (see also: Rumsfeld matrix: what we know we know and what we don't know we don't know)

> _Not knowing the scope of your own ignorance is part of the human condition. The problem with it is we see it in other people, and we don't see it in ourselves. The first rule of the Dunning–Kruger club is you don't know you're a member of the Dunning–Kruger club._

This cognitive bias is commonly seen as a defect in a professional context, but the reality is that we all suffer from this. 

A day to day example may be, if you just read Atomic Habits, then you probably feel that are better than a lot of people in habits, but you still hadn't made any progress on it. So you think you know more than you know in reality. 

This happens after reading a book, watching a YouTube video, hearing a podcast or even taking a course. 

If you don't take action on what you are learning, the knowledge is destined to get lost.
