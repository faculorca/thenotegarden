# Your standards are what determine your taste.

> [!QUOTE] Original Capture
> DEVELOP YOUR TASTE

The standards are what determine your taste.

Yesterday (2025-09-25) I went out to eat with my girlfriend and we talked about she starting an Instagram account to re-start her art interest. Several times throughout the conversation she said:

“I’m not good enough”

First of all, that’s not true, I love her sketches, they are actually good. 

So I told her that “any person that’s not you would say those sketches are *pretty good*”

It kinda needed some pushing for her to accept it, but she did.

Her problem is that her standards are too high. She compares herself with practicing artists that post incredible things online. 

Her taste grew at the same pace her skills did, so she is not confident that what she creates is good.

You can take that and say “ok, let’s not waste more time here, I’m not good enough”, or…

You could leverage this developed taste into being useful. Knowing what you aspire to create, means you know when progress is being made.

Imagine having a mediocre taste, you thing what you do it’s good enough, so you don’t try to get better, you just… repeat. 

If you are not uncomfortable with where you are now, it’s impossible to get better.

Improving ANY skill requieres you to be unsatisfied with your current results.

see: I first heard of this use of taste in [[[2] References/Articles/The Death of Thoughtful Creation by Dan Koe#id941697784|The Death of Thoughtful Creation by Dan Koe]], this note is completely independent of it.
