I can't help writing for someone else.

When I journal, I write to myself from the future, I want to paint a small picture of what my life is in this moment, so I can sometime go back to what I was thinking or struggling with.

But also one thing that I love to do is teach through writing. That's why I wrote [[Newsletter W45 - The Obsidian Guide You Wish You Had]] last week. Is a guide on how to use Obsidian, written for my past self, but also for anyone who is one step behind me.
