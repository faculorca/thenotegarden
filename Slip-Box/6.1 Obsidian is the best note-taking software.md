# 6.1 Obsidian is the best note-taking software

I’ve been [taking and making notes]([[2.1b3 The difference between note making and note taking]]) for 7+ years now. I’ve tried

- Notion
- Evernote
- Roam Research
- Kortex 

Some of them I used for years, and I was even in the closed beta of Kortex and paid the full subscription.

But every damn time I end up coming back to Obsidian.

And is the best for several reasons:

1. You have complete control of your notes. If obsidian any day cease to exist, you will still have access to your notes in any other system you’d want to.
	- [[6.1a Having control of your notes is rare in todays age]]

2. Your mind is unique, your workflow is unique and your systems will end up being unique. Having thousands of free plugins at your disposal and being highly customizable, Obsidian takes the lead here.
	- [[6.1b Your note system should adapt to your needs]]

3. Proprietary systems respond mainly to the interests of the business and investors more than the needs of the users.
	- [[6.1c Obsidian is free and flexible]]
