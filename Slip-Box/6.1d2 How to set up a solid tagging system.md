# 6.1d2 How to set up a solid tagging system

I’ve always struggled with tags.

And I’m still not sure on how to use them effectively.

But I think now I’ve built a sustainable system to use them, and that is replacing folders.

I use them mainly in two ways:

- Organization
- Categorization

## Organizational Tags

```
#fleeting - fleeting notes get this tag automatically
#mainNote - notes from my zettelkasten
#referenceNote - articles, books and video highlights
#tweet - imported tweets waiting to be templatized
#daily - daily notes get this automatically
#newsletter - for newsletters
#asleep - fleeting notes that I don't want to delete nor tackle
#ContentOS - my version of Justin Welsh's system
#ContentTemplate - ready-to-use templates
```

## Categorization Tags

```
#zettelkasten 
#Writing 
#solopreneurship 
#ContentCreation 
#CriticalThinking 
#Communication 
#habits 
#HumanBehavior 
#mentalModels 
```

This eases up the road for clusters of notes to build over time. Clusters ease the way towards a writing piece
