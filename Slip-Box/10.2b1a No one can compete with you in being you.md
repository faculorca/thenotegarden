# 10.2b1a No one can compete with you in being you

You don’t want to start doing something and compete with what is already out there.

Yes, competition will always be there ([[10.2b1a1 Every solution to a problem competes with the prior way of solving it|10.2b1a1]]), but you shouldn’t aim to compete.

Your own biggest unfair advantage is being you ([[10.2b1a2 Your biggest unfair advantage is being yourself|10.2b1a2]]), so you might as well leverage it.

A lot of people can compete with you if you try to become the biggest in a niche, but no one can compete with you on being you.

*Side note: there’s this quote of Mac Miller I can’t remember exactly, nor find anywhere what said something on the line of  “I’m not the next anyone, I’m the first Mac Miller”*
