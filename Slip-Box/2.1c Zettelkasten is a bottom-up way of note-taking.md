Bottom-up and top-down are strategies of composition of systemics.

Basically systems of systems.

A bottom-up approach starts with small systems and grow them into a bigger and more complex system.

When it comes to information, a bottom-up is based on processing incoming data from the environment to form a perception.

SUBSTACK NOTE
In the same way you process information of your environment to build perception, a note-making system is a bottom-up system.

You write small notes and connect them to build a bigger, stronger system.

see: [[Mental models are the way we understand reality]] because a perception is a way to understand reality. So our perception is based on mental models.
