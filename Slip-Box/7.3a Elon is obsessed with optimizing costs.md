[[Elon Musk]] is obsessed with cost reduction. You can see this in almost every company he has been.

For example in [[Tesla]] he used his inspiration in toy cars to question why cars didn't mold the base like toys. The answer was that there wasn't any foundry that would mold that size. So he insisten on his team to get one or make a custom one. All of that reduced complexity and costs in the company.
