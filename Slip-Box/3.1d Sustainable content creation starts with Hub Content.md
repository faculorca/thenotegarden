# 3.1d Sustainable content creation starts with Hub Content

Hub Content is the long form piece you write with a determined frequency.

The most common alternatives are newsletters, podcasts and long-form YouTube.

With a Hub piece of content, you can create a lot of short-form about it and then plug a link to the long-form piece.

Short-form is for growth. Long form for depth.
