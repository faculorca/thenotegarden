# 5.1a1a The Creator Flywheel

The creator flywheel is a way to create content in a more sustainable way.

A flywheel is a heavy spinning wheel used to store and regulate energy in mechanical systems or an energy storage device that stores kinetic energy.

Motors have a flywheel to turn the violent explosions into a continuous source of kinetic energy.

As a creator, we often fall into the traditional hand pump approach.

- Sit down, write, post. 
- Sit down, write, get stuck, delete. 
- Sit down, zero ideas, scroll socials.

This is how it feels not having a flywheel.

A flywheel keeps momentum. At rest is heavy and hard to rotate, but once it’s spinning, it only gets easier.

Nathan Barry states that a flywheel needs to meet three criteria:

1. Activities flow smoothly from one into the next.
2. Each rotation is *easier* than the previous rotation.
3. Each rotation *produces more* than the previous rotation.

The article Nathan posted [here](https://nathanbarry.com/creator-flywheels/) has some interesting examples on how to build an audience leveraging content flywheels.
