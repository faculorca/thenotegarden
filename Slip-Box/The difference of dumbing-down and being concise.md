# The difference of dumbing-down and being concise

Dumbing things down is assuming your audience is way too dumb to understand your topic. So you water down or remove the information, creating  an empty and uninteresting explanation of what is complex and fascinating.

Being concise means conveying a lot of valuable information in as fewest and simple words, images or whatever.

The first have dull and shallow results; the second can project infinite complexity and fascination.

> Just ask a mathematician about concision. It's the difference between the clumsy mathematician who needs 100 steps to solve an equation and the skilled one who can do it in 5 simple steps. The latter is arrived at either by genius or by hard work. And that's all I'm advocating for science communication—that you be either a genius or a hard worker. That you accept that poor communicators are able to say the same basic things as good communicators—they just need a lot more time and space in which to do it, which ends up boring everyone.
