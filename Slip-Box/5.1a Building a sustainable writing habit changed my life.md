# 5.1a Building a sustainable writing habit changed my life
 
After going for walks, drinking enough water and getting good sleep and meditating, I think writing frequently is one of the best habits you can have.

Walks, water and sleep are all for taking care of the body. Writing is for taking care of the mind. Writing every single day has changed my life in ways I wouldn’t have thought.

I’ve connected with people all around the globe doing great things and their dream life. Creators who have a massive following and people who I thought were simply on another level.

But most importantly, I have clarity of mind. I now know how I want my life to be and how I would despise it to be.

Writing every single day, even if I write just 200 words on my worst days, has given me the answers to problems I’ve been carrying for years.
