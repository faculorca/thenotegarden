# 10.2b3a2b If you want to learn anything, read the fundamentals

*This idea I basically take it from Naval. I don’t remember where the quote lives, and probably is kept in my mind from listening to his podcasts again and again.*

If you want to learn anything from scratch, the best way is to go to the basics.

If you’re going to learn something that don’t change, like human behavior, philosophy or evolution, you should probably be better up reading books that survived the test of time and are already proved.

If you want to learn from stoicism go read Seneca or Marco Aurelio. If you want to learn evolution, read The Origin of Species.

In case that you’re learning something modern like computers, AI or biotech, this approach will not be that useful. But there will be some books that are validated through time and it’s well known that are great resources. Go look for those books.

Here are some more examples of books by topic.
