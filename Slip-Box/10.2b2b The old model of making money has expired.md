# 10.2b2b The old model of making money has expired

The way of getting money nowadays is not only dusted. It’s rotten.

And people still has this old model tattooed on their brains.

Go to university for 4-7 years, get your degree, work as a professional for 30 years.

That doesn’t work anymore, industries are changing way too fast and everyone is reinventing themselves after four years.

That’s why effective learning is the best skill to have in this new era of work.

Now, you have to come up to speed on a new profession within nine months, and it’s obsolete four years later. But within those three productive years, you can get very wealthy.
