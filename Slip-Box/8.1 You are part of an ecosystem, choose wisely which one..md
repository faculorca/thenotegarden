# 8.1 You are part of an ecosystem, choose wisely which one.

*this thread or train of thought is about the relationship between a human and their environment*

We are all part of our little own ecosystems.

The people surrounding you, the city you live in, the creators you see online. Everything that surrounds you is your ecosystem, and you are part of it.

This is THE thing that have the most impact in your life. Ever.

That’s why certain niches clusters around a certain area, like Silicon Valley.
