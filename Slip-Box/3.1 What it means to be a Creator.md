# 3.1 What it means to be a Creator

Today we have commoditized the “content creator” ([[3.1a We should stop creating content and start creating art and value]]).

A Creator is not a content creator.

A Creator is an artist dedicated to their craft. A person who truly believes in what they do and don’t doubt in standing for what they believe.

A Creator put their art open to the world to see, and is able to create value, monetize and create a life of freedom by doing so.
