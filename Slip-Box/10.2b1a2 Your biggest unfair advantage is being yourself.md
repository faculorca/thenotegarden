# 10.2b1a2 Your biggest unfair advantage is being yourself

An unfair advantage is something that it’s hard to replicate.

When we think of unfair advantages, the usual thing is to think about a specific mix of talents and skills in one person or team.

But this goes beyond that.

The biggest unfair advantage, the thing that NO ONE can replicate, is being yourself.

No one has had the same experiences, the same parents, the same life and the same emotions and thoughts.

No one can beat you at being you.
