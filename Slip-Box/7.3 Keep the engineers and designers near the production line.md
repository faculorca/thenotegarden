# 7.3 Keep the engineers and designers near the production line

This is an idea I heard about in the podcast episode “How Elon Works” by David Senra in *Founders* podcast.

In Tesla and SpaceX Elon keeps the workers next to one another. The engineers and designers that create prototypes and the models of different pieces, need to be near the production line.

This allows for quick intervention and for the engineers and designers to see how his model is failed ASAP.

This optimizes speed, therefore time, therefore costs.

And Elon is obsessed with costs.
