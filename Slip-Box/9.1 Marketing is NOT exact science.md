# 9.1 Marketing is NOT exact science

In *Scientific Advertising*, Claude Hopkins says that “advertising and merchandising become exact sciences”

> [!QUOTE]
> Nearly every selling question which arises in business is accurately answered by many experiences.
> 
> Under these conditions, where they long exist, advertising and merchandising become exact sciences. Every course is charted. The compass of accurate knowledge directs the shortest, safest, cheapest course to any destination.

But the popular opinion is not this. Marketing is related to human behavior, that means that it can’t be exact science.

It can have a scientific approach, and that is recommended. Taking data as signals in the noise and making decisions based on what is already working and resonating with the audience.
