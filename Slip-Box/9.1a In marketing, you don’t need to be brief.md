# 9.1a In marketing, you don’t need to be brief

It’s usual to read that you need to be brief because attention spans are too little.

But this is not always the case.

A person that is really interested in buying your thing, will want to know more and read what your product/service can offer them.

This doesn’t mean you should not be concise.

Use the less amount of words possible to deliver a message.

But give all the information your client want in the copy of your advertisement.
