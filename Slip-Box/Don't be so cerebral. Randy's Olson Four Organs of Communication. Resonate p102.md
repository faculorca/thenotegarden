We were trained to create stuff from our heads, being as intelectual and smart as possible.

- Do proper research
- Write in an objective and unpersonal way
- Aim for getting high grades
- Study for tests, learning is second-hand

Institutions reward and encourage workers and students to be on the analytical side of their brain most of the time. Yet, the emotional part is what people connect the most with. Is the place where hunches, hypotheses and passions are born. Great ideas need those.

I have a degree in biotechnology, that means that I’m part of one of the most indoctrinated groups of society. They teach us not only how to do science, but to think science.

Thinking science as the academy teaches is completely cold and analytical. Or so they say, because the reality is not that. The reality is that science requieres an emotional appeal too. 

When discussing hypothesis for explaining anything, we use common sense and our own logic, that’s not *objective* if we say so. So why if, instead of living too much on our analytical appeal as creators, we embrace the emotional appeal.

In his short book “*Don’t Be Such a Scientist*”, Randy Olson separated four organs of communication in two categories: analytical appeal and emotional appeal.

**Analytical Appeal**

1. **The Head** – The home of brainiacs. This “*Organ*” is characterized for a large amount of logic and analysis. When we try to think our way out of a problem, this is the main part we are using. “Think before you act” are the words analytical people live by.

**Emotional Appeal**

Below our heads lie spontaneity and intuition. They are the opposite part of the spectrum. They are have a way higher risk (for not being well thought through), but in them hides the potential for something extraordinary.
2. **The Heart** – Home of the passionate, people driven by the heart are emotional, deeply connected with their feelings, sentimental and crippled by love.
3. **The Gut** – Where humor and instinct comes from (having a gut feeling about something). As we get farther from the head, people driven by their gut is less rational and prone to being impulsive and spontaneous. These are the “just do it” people.
4. **The Groin** – Countless men and women have risked and lost everything in their lives out of passion. There’s no logic here, yet the power is enormous and the dynamics universal. (Cleopatra is an historical example of it)

We should drop the spreadsheets from time to time and try to get the most amount of ideas we can from lower places.

Is there where we can imagine *what could be* and reach for the most risky, bold and exciting ideas. We can later pull them up for an analytical perspective on those ideas.

We will probably create more ideas that get scrapped, but if we can bring just 1 idea that is an outlier, it’s worth it.
