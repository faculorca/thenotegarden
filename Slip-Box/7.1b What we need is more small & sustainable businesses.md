# 7.1b What we need is more small & sustainable businesses

It seems like a lot of people want to become the next Uber, Airbnb, [other unicorns].

Why though?

Becoming a giant company will give you money and “happiness”, for a while.

You may think “I know I don’t *need it*, but I want to scale and get BIG money”.

The truth is that you no longer need to build a giant company to get such a thing. There are people all over the internet offering digital products and services, building a business with %90+ of profit and working by themselves.

What I’m saying is that now, more than ever before, have the power of bootstrapping our own businesses off the ground.
