# 10.2a SM58 and Samson Q8 are the gold standard of podcast microphones

These two models are the gold standard. That’s why I want to buy one of those.

The big problem is that there are way too many clones, so I don’t know if I should just buy a clone or do an initial investment on good audio equipment.
