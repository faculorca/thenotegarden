# 7.2 If you want to convince investors, convince yourself first

I read this in the Paul Graham essay called “[[How to Convince Investors by Paul Graham|How to Convince Investors]]”.

This idea resonated a lot because it goes up to the principles of human nature. Unless you are a great actor (which most people are not), you are better off telling the truth.

It is way easier to convince someone of something that you are 100% sure is true than to convince someone of something you are not.

So convince yourself first.

> That's the secret. Convince yourself that your startup is worth investing in, and then when you explain this to investors they'll believe you. And by convince yourself, I don't mean play mind games with yourself to boost your confidence. I mean truly evaluate whether your startup is worth investing in. If it isn't, don't try to raise money.
