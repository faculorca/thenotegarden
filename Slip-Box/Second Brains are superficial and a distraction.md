> [!QUOTE] Original Capture
> Second Brains are superficial and a distraction

People often build Second Brains or Zettelkastens with the honest intention of improving their learning and articulating their ideas, but most of them fail and never try again. And there’s one main reason why they fail:

They think themselves as *Knowledge Collectors*.

When you are a mere collector, you are limited in superficial knowledge hoarding that ends up being a distraction from the work that really matters.

I believe in a [[Instead of building a Second Brain, build a PKM system as a mental workbench|Mental Workbench]] more than I believe in Second Brains.

And also, most people online who are against Second Brains tend to be from a place of a rant about PKMs being a waste of time and not a real asset to have. I disagree deeply with that.

see: [[The PARA method and the CODE framework are failed at their core]] – some pillars of the Second Brain are dumbed down to uselessness.

see: [[The Mental Workbench]] – I believe you should imagine PKMs and writing more as a bench than a brain.
