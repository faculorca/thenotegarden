# 1.1c Anti fragile systems are everywhere

Anti-fragile systems are everywhere, from mathematics, economics, molecular biology or business. These are some examples I love:

- **The Executive and The Taxi Driver**: A highly paid executive with an expensive lifestyle and debts is way more fragile to a crash in the market and unemployment than a self-employed taxi-driver with no debts, whose a crisis won't hurt him that much.
- **Your Body**: When you train your body, you are tearing up muscle, breaking muscular fibers, just for them to recover bigger and stronger. When you go for a run, your demand of oxygen is higher than usual, for beginners this often leads to a blood taste on the mouth, but your lungs will eventually get better at working at higher oxygen demands, and that taste will stop appearing.
- **Growth Mindset**: The belief that abilities can be developed though effort rather than being fixed traits. You can improve performance by shifting the focus from identity-based labels to effort-based processes. Combined with an antifragile mindset creates a synergistic effect that improve learning and performance in any domain.
