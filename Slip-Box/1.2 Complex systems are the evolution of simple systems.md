If you try to build an over the top system from a scratch, it’s going to be too much.

You need to start simple and grow as the system requieres it.

That’s why borrowing systems that are not yours is a bad idea.

Systems are adapted and ingrained to their context. If you take them out of it, nothing can ensures you that it works equally as well as before.
