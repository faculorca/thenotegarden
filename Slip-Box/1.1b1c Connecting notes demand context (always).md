I used to connect my notes and ideas in a way that was simple and it looked great on the graph view. It ended up being kind of useless.

I wrote and then connected the ideas, everything made sense in the moment. But when I went back to them, I couldn't get the why behind half of the links.

It wasn't until I read it in [[Bob Doto]]'s book that I though "oh, I really should write why I made that connection."

Adding even a small bit of context helps the future you understand why you wanted to say.
