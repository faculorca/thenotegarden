# 10.2b3a2 Liquid knowledge is fundamental knowledge

Liquid knowledge is fundamental knowledge.

This helps you transfer the knowledge from one place to another.

As Naval said, it’s much better to master the fundamentals and don’t mind much about the details. Or as Elon said:

> “It is important to view knowledge as sort of a semantic tree — make sure you understand the fundamental principles, i.e. the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang on to.”

There’s no use in memorizing the details and specifics of a complex system if you don’t understand the basics and how it works.

You get nothing by learning how cells get energy if you don’t know anything about thermodynamics.

There is no point in learning taxonomic trees without learning about the theory of evolution first.

Another name for these *trunks* or fundamentals is “Mental Models”
