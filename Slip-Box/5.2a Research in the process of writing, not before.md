# 5.2a Research in the process of writing, not before

Writing is a craft that requieres taking ideas and words and tinkering with them in ways that the idea is conveyed through the language.

When you start writing, you unveil the gaps in your knowledge really fast. Those are the gaps you have to fill.

If you consume content around a specific topic and just consume, consume, consume, you’ll end up not writing at all because it’s harder to be concise and go straight to the point.

Start your writing with what you know about the topic. Do an outline or just a brain dump to find the gaps, and then fill them. Not the other way around.
