# 3.2d Building a personal brand is not about ego and selfies

Building a personal brand is not about you.

**Is about what you can do for the world.**

Is about putting yourself out there, position as a leader and authority, and become someone who can help others.

It’s not about showing off your success or how much money you have.

It’s always about others.
