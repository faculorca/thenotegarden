# 5.1 Writing is hard work

At surface, writing is a fairly simple task. You sit down, put hands to your keyboard and start typing your thoughts.

The results of it may vary. You can end up with a good first draft, a mediocre piece or even a blank page.

William Zinsser, a man who’s mission in life was to help people write and think better,said this on his book “*On Writing Well*”:

> Writing is hard work. A clear sentence is no accident. Very few sentences come out right the first time, or even the third time. Remember this in moments of despair. If you find that writing is hard, it’s because it is hard.

Writing is really hard because it demands you to clear your mind and untangle the mess of thoughts and ideas on your brain.

Writing is hard work.

Anyone who says is not, is not writing enough.
