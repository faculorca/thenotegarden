# World-class thinkers are often silo-free thinkers

In school and life we tend to separate knowledge into different silos: biology, economics, history, philosophy, technology. In reality and in your brain information is more fluent and connected between itself, rarely divided into this defined categories.

All world-class thinkers are often silo-free thinkers (see: [[Deep Generalism]]). They avoid looking at life through just one lens and develop what some people call “_Liquid Knowledge_” that flows easily from one topic to the next.

Each one of these lenses is a mental model (see: [[Mental models are the way we understand reality| Mental Models]]). The combination, fusion and even the blind-spots each person has through their multiple lenses is what generates the intersection of ideas needed for creativity and innovation.
