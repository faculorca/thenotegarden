# 1.1b1 Zettelkastens are build upon the connection between trains of thought

Previously I always thought of zettelkasten as a way to connect ideas, but is more than that.

My way of thinking about it was “capture the idea, process it and connect it to others”. That is a good way to do it, but you are losing on the zettelkasten flow.

At the moment of writing, starting ideas prime your mind for new ideas, and they get connected in a logical way. That is a train of thought.

If you take those trains of thought and separate the ideas into different notes instead of one long note, you’ll end up with somewhat of a tree of knowledge (contra: [[1.1b1b Zettelkastends do not build a tree of knowledge]])

But each idea is not only connected to it’s corresponding train of thought, but connected to notes that at surface level may not be related (see: [[1.1b1c Connecting notes demand context (sometimes)]])
