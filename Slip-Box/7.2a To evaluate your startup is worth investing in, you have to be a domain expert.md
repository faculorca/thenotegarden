# 7.2a To evaluate your startup is worth investing in, you have to be a domain expert

*This idea is from [[How to Convince Investors by Paul Graham]]*

If you want to persuade investors to put THEIR money in your team and dream, you not only need to be persuasive, you need to be an expert.

If you don’t really know your thing, then you are just selling snake oil.

And investors WILL notice it.
