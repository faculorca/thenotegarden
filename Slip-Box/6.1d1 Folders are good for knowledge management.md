# 6.1d1 Folders are good for knowledge management

A few days ago I thought of writing a note on why folders are a problem themselves, but when I sat down to elaborate, it had a lot of nuances.

Folders are great (if used correctly).

This is how I use them

```
[0] Inbox - for the fleeting notes
[1] Zettelkasten - for the main notes
[2] Reference - for the reference notes
[3] Hub Content - for writing projects (mainly newsletters)
[4] Projects - currently inactive
[5] Templates - for quick access templates
[6] Prompts - saving prompts for frequent use
[7] Daily Notes - for all my daily notes
[99] Assets - for all the attachments
```

Everything I need is contained in those folders. But I barely use them tbh.

I use bookmarks.
