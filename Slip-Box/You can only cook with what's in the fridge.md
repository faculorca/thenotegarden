In [[George Orwell]]'s 1984, one way Big Brother used to control people was to reduce vocabulary.

Instead of using words like great, terrific, magnificent, amazing, lovely, true or wonderful, the only word for that was good.

There's good, there's un-good, there's plus-good and double-plus-good.

Without a rich variety of words, the expression of feelings and ideas is impossible.

This is one big reason to read and to watch quality content. Because quick and shallow is everywhere.
