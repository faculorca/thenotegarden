# 1.1b2 Imagine zettelkastens as a jar and notes as air

Let’s say that out PKM is a sealed jar of a limited volume (which is not), but let’s pretend.

When you put air into it, pressure is going to go up and particles will move faster and faster. This leads to molecules crashing and linking between one another, creating a new compound just by increasing the pressure on the jar.

When you put notes into your PKM, you are increasing pressure and ideas will start to collide and crash. Some ideas will even be repeated, but it doesn’t matter. New connections are being created and those trains of thought are the ones that carry the interconnection.
