# 2.1 The Zettelkasten is a tool for thinking and writing

Whether is a _Commonplace Book_, a Zettelkasten, or a Second Brain (whatever you call your PKM system) the core principle remains the same:

**Your ideas can connect and evolve beyond the limitations of your mind.**

You will create a lot of notes, and soon you'll realize that not all notes are the same. Some of them are from reading, others are thoughts.

Here you will learn how to be smart about the notes you take and how to create your Knowledge Garden.

The key is finding a system that minimizes friction between capturing an idea and connecting it to your existing knowledge.
