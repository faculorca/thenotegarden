# 6.1d2b Using file properties for tagging is key for using Obsidian bases

Using tags is really useful for a solid knowledge management system (see [[6.1d2 How to set up a solid tagging system]]).

Even if you could add tags in-line, you shouldn’t do that (at least as the main way of tagging).

What works best is setting up tags in the properties of every file you create. I like to add as a bare minimum the date the note was created and the organizational tags (in most cases `mainNote`).

For the automations I have in my workplace, like the Obsidian Web Clipper or Readwise, I have a much more complete metadata stack.
