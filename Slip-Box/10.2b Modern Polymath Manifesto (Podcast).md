# 10.2b Modern Polymath Manifesto

We all can (and should) become modern polymaths. People who cultivate knowledge across multiple–and sometimes unrelated–fields.

Interdisciplinary thinking is what differentiates you from everyone else. A scientist that also plays music, an architect who loves to cook, a driver who is reads philosophy, a physician that has great communication.

That’s the future of work. Information is already everywhere, connecting it in relevant ways is the most important skill in this age.

**The future is in the hands of the polymaths. People who can connect the dots. People who are creatives and innovators.**

## Why?

Elegí un podcast porque creo en la profundidad. Actualmente la mayoría del consumo en internet es superficial y vacío, pero hay personas ahí afuera que eligen la profundidas por sobre la velocidad. Para ellos es este podcast.

Creo fielmente que el futuro está en las manos de los polímatas
