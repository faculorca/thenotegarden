# 2.1a1a Building your first side-hustle

This note in particular is a manual copy paste.

1. Pick a topic you can talk about for 30 minutes unprepared.
2. Create daily content on social media sharing your knowledge
3. When people ask questions, DM & schedule calls.
4. Listen for common challenges during your calls.
5. Create a short video product to address those.
6. Send it to the folks you helped on those calls.
7. Ask for testimonials in exchange for it.
8. Add the testimonials to your website.
9. Charge $50 for your new course.
10. Start charging $250 for calls.

Now you have two revenue streams:

1. A simple coaching call ($250)
2. A simple video product ($50)

- Make the product your low-end item.
- Make the coaching call your high-end item.
- Use email automation to collect more testimonials.

If people can’t spend $250, direct them to the product.

At the end of the product, share a link to schedule a call.

And around the cycle goes.
