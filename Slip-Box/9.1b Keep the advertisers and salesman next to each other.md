# 9.1b Keep the advertisers and salesman next to each other

Salesman are the people who are face to face with the prospect, client and customer. They know what works and what don’t. They see the faces of the people reacting to their words.

Advertisers are the ones that scale those emotions. They NEED to resonate with the ideal customer/client.

If salesman and advertisers work isolated from each other, the message is going to be all over the place.

And you don’t want that.
