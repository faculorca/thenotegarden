# 5.1a2 The writing habit loop

![[5.1a2 The writing habit loop.png]]
## Capture and generate ideas
You can have your own ideas, but sometimes our idea tank is dry. Don’t be scared to take others ideas and make it your own. Remember that the human hand is uncapable of perfect copy (Austin Kleon btw).

My system for jotting down ideas is chaotic but more functional than ever. The main principle is keeping it frictionless. I take fleeting notes on my Obsidian, on a physical pocket notebooks with detachable pages, and whatsapping myself.

How can I avoid losing ideas? I don’t. If an idea is lost is because it wasn’t that good after all, so I archive them or directly delete them.

Practice non-attachment with your ideas.
## Write content
Sit down with a timer and focus on just writing for at least 45 minutes.

You may’ve heard about Parkinson law “work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.”

Give yourself a time limit.  Get it done even if it’s not good.
## Choose an idea
Pick whatever idea resonates with you at the moment and wing it. You’ll discover if it had something great or not.

## Create an outline
Before you start an article, write a few bullet points of the things you want to put on the table. This will draw a line towards the finished piece and working on it will be much, much easier.

Ask yourself:
- What is it that I’m writing about?
- What’s good/bad about it?
- What’s the change I want in the reader?
- And any other question you find interesting.

## Re-read it once
Editing is the key to good writing.

Don’t skip the editing.

But don’t over-do it either.

Depending on the relevance of the piece, you might want to make multiple rounds.

For writing online, just once will do the trick.

## Hit publish & share
Share it. 

If you wrote something amazing, set it out to the world.

If it’s not something amazing, set it out to the world.

And share it. Share it. Share it. Share it.

Be proud of what you create, and show everyone you did.

Get the feedback in, take the ideas and ignore the useless comments.

That’s how you start the flywheel of writing.
