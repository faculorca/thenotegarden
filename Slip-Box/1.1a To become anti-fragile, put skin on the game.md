# To become anti-fragile, put skin on the game

> [!QUOTE]
> To me, every opinion maker needs to have "skin in the game" in the event of harm caused by reliance on his information or opinion. Further, anyone producing a forecast or making an economic analysis needs to have something to lose from it, given that others rely on those forecasts (to repeat, forecasts induce risk taking; they are more toxic to us than any other form of human pollution).
