Niching down or staying niche-less is an active discussion on the internet.

One side trying to solve a specific problem, the other appealing to the multifaceted nature of human beings.

There's truth to both of them, and picking a side in this discussion is a personal choice.

But I believe that you are your own niche. ([[12.1a You are your own niche]])

As creativity is such a human and intuitive thing, if it helps you with creation and building products and art, it's probably best to let that decision be guided by your gut.

Try both, experiment with both. Se which one ends up being successful and how you feel with it.

Nothing is black and white.
