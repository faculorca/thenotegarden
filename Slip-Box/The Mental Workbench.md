# The Mental Workbench

The Mental Workbench is identity-driven. Your notes are a reflection of you, because you create them (see [[2.1b3 The difference between note making and note taking|note making]]).

People love to create the famous "second brain", but I don't think we need a second brain. I believe that we need a space where words are our raw material and systems are our tools.

A place where we can take the most basic raw material (fleeting notes) and turn them into bite-sized notes, and evolving them after into an article in on itself. 

It's a place where you go almost every day. Ideal for knowledge workers, but mainly focused on creators. It's a place to put all the ideas on the table and tinker around with them. 

Some of the main problems they'd have with the Mental Workbench are: 

1. **Friction** - Most systems tend to have various layers of complexity in systems that are uncomfortable to use and put a barrier between you and creativity. 
2. **Lack of focus** - It doesn't matter if it's ADHD or dopamine-fried brains because of social media, most people lack the ability to keep sustained focus on a cognitive dense task. 
3. **The system clutters faster than we clean it**. Not stablishing practices to prune out mental garden, things get out of control pretty easily.
