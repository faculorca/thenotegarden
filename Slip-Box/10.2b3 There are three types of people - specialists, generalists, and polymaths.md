# 10.2b3 There are three types of people - specialists, generalists, and polymaths

There are three types of people in the world:

- specialists.
- generalists,
- and polymaths.

You can visualize this using a T-shape. The horizontal line represents the breadth and diversity of your knowledge. The vertical line represents depth.

Specialists have a short horizontal line and a much longer vertical one. They know their field deeply and often create new knowledge within it. But they’re isolated in their niche, unable to see beyond their walls.

Generalists have a much longer horizontal line. Their knowledge is broad, diverse, and—here’s the problem—_**general**_. Surface-level. It’s hard to create meaningful change in the world from superficial understanding alone.

Polymaths combine both. They have diverse knowledge _and_ depth. They can connect ideas across different domains, generate novel insights, and take action on their understanding.
