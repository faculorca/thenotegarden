# 10.1 Building a bio marketing agency may be my category of one

I was listening to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymiBDged-eQ) video of Tim Ferriss about how to start a business or podcast, and it hit me this feeling I’ve been growing in the back of my mind.

see [[10.2 Starting a podcast about business, writing and human behavior]] because it’s also an idea that came from that Tim Ferriss video.
