# 10.2b1 Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your innate talents

Specific knowledge is the kind of knowledge and skills that are part of your identity.

Your specific knowledge is in the intersection of your almost obsessive interests and passions.

Is not about the job that will give you money and you do well. And definitely is not about what the richest people in the world say is the the future.
