# 5.2a1 Lean Writing is the smartest way to become a writer

Being a writer doesn’t mean you are an author, or you have a big audience that reads you.

**Being a writer means that you write.**

If you want to become a writer that people read, then the best place to start is following Lean Writing.

The concept is about having enough material to collect feedback and then act upon the it instead of doing a ton of work and repeated trial and error only for the final product to flop.

In writing, this looks like writing notes, writing articles and sharing them quickly to collect data.

Some of the best places to start doing this are X, LinkedIn and Substack, which main content format is written.

Get the data and act on the things that get more engagement.

Ideally, this would be something that gained a bit of traction/showed you that readers were interested in this sort of topic.
