# 10.2b3a All great thinkers are silo-free thinkers

> “All the wisdom in the world cannot be found in a small academic department.” 
> — Charlie Munger

Schools and society teach us to separate knowledge into silos: biology, economics, history, philosophy, technology. This helps us categorize and specialize.

But your brain doesn’t work in silos. Reality doesn’t work in silos.

In your mind, information is fluid and interconnected. It rarely divides into such closed categories.

All great thinkers are silo-free thinkers. Or what I like to call them: polymaths.
