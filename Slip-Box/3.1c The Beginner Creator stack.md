# 3.1c The Beginner Creator stack

If you want to start as a creator, this is the cheapest stack ever (adapted from [Justin Welsh]([[[2] References/Tweets/My Little One-Person Business Does ~$189kMo in Revenue by Justin Welsh#id941645391]])):

- Writing: Obsidian
- CRM: Notion
- Publishing: Buffer
- Website: Carrd
- Course + Email: Gumroad

That stack is almost free.
It’s what Justin used for 2 years and crossed $500,000 with it.

I’d like to know how this would seem like with Substack, Kit and all of that stuff.
