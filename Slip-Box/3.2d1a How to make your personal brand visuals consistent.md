# 3.2d1a How to make your personal brand visuals consistent

When someone sees your content online, even if it’s not in your account, they should know is you who is behind it.

That is the power of visual identity.

For it to be consistent you should pick:

- A consistent color palette
- 2 main fonts (3 if you know what you’re doing)
- A logo or symbol.

That’s it. Use them consistently everywhere and don’t overcomplicate things at the beginning.
