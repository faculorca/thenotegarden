# 4.1 A lifestyle business is about full freedom

A lifestyle business isn’t about growing a giant company, getting VC funds or IPO’s.

A lifestyle business is barely about KPI’s and cash flows.

A lifestyle business is about freedom.

About living by your own means, working on what you want to work on, and being with the person you want to be in the place you want to be.

Is more lifestyle than business.

You don’t need big numbers for that.
