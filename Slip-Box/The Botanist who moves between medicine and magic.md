I got inspired with this idea from this video.

I really like the concept of a character who dances in between medicine and magic using plants.

Where's the limit in what *should* you use.

And what if the thing you want to do is resurrect someone?

This concept can be repeated or emulated with almost anything related to non-human forces.
