# 10.2b2 The best jobs are creative expressions of continuous learners in free markets

The future of work is not degrees or employees.

The future of work is the expression of continuous learners.

Creative expression as a way to say something getting created and available to the public.

Continuous learners as a way to represent people bettering themselves.
