Replace the {TARGET AUDIENCE} section with your audience and hit send!

Example audience:

- 20 year olds who want to start a side hustle
- Corporate professionals who struggle with productivity
- Mothers who are coping with a stressful career

```
I'm writing content for {TARGET AUDIENCE}.

It has to be educational, entertaining, and attention-grabbing.

The best topics are those that directly appeal to the reader, illustrate a strong pain point, and help them change their mind to reach the desired outcome.

Here's how we'll proceed:

- Find 10 specific struggles that my audience is facing.
- Find 10 specific desires my audience wants to achieve.
- Come up with 10 specific topics that I can pick from. Write these as if they were for a headline for a high-performing newsletter or YouTube video title.

Do not ask me to clarify the target audience. Only output the struggles, desires, and topics in a numbered list.
