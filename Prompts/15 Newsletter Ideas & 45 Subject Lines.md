I want you to act as my newsletter strategist.

My client sells {PRODUCT NAME} and I'm emailing the list to try and get more sales for my client. The next step for people on the list is to {buy the product/Book a call with my sales team/Apply for the product/program}.

Now, for my target audience {YOUR AUDIENCE HERE}, please do the following:

Step 1: Audience Insights

1. List 10 specific struggles this audience faces.

2. List 10 specific desires this audience wants to achieve.

Step 2: Newsletter Ideas

Using those struggles and desires, generate 5 concrete topic ideas for each of these three newsletter types:

1. Evergreen Newsletter

- Purely educational—no pitches.

- Designed to build trust by delivering free, high-value content.

2. Indirect Newsletter

- A narrative or pain-point driven email with a soft sell.

- Not focused on “how to” education; instead, it highlights a problem or transformation and gently points to your paid offer as the solution. These emails are about removing faulty beliefs and showing the consequences if someone takes action.

3. Direct Newsletter

- A clear, no-nonsense call to action using the specific product/CTA you provided.

- Designed to convert readers who are already familiar with your value.

For each newsletter topic idea, give me 3 subject lines. These are not headlines so should be written in uppercase and lowercase as if in a sentence.

Here are rules for writing compelling subject lines:

Create email subject lines using one of these 6 approaches:

1. Highlight a conflict/problem moment

2. Promise specific knowledge

3. Focus on the end result

4. Warn about mistakes

5. Show transformation

6. Compare solutions

Each approach should be specific, hint at value, and create curiosity without giving every.

Aim to write 5-7 words per subject line.
