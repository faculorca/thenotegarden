# How To Learn Anything Faster (Without Fancy Techniques)
The last point is what stick everything together.

One of the things I've repeated again and again this last year is that if you want to learn anything effectively, you should write.

But in all honesty, it's not the only thing you can or should do to superpower your learning.

Watching tutorials, reading books and guides and attending classes will make you learn a thing or two. But if you want to make everything you learn stay for a while and actually be useful, you need to do more.

In the past, learning after getting your degree was slightly rewarded and seen as a way to improve yourself. An extra that was well perceived.

Today, things are different. Learning after getting a degree is needed. For anything you'd want to do. So if you want to improve your chances of succeeding there are two main things to do:

1. Learn how to learn
2. Write about what you learn

In this newsletter, we'll focus on the first. And I'm not going into recall, spaced repetition, memory palaces and all of that stuff. That is useful if you're trying to memorize things. I don't care about memorizing stuff, I care about understanding.

The last point is what stick them all together.

Let's start.

## Taking notes

Notes are a topic I can talk for hours, but I'll be brief. Take notes as you wish to do it, but take notes in your own words. Try to avoid copy-pasting as much as possible, try to avoid just highlighting things.

Take YOUR notes. Whatever you find meaningful in a book, class, video or podcast is not the same another person would've found relevant (yes, even yourself in another moment).

Taking notes with your own words reinforces the way it's saved in your brain, because explaining it in your own words forces you to fit the idea one way or another into your understanding of the world.

So, take notes. Make them something unique to you, relate them to things you already know and see it as a conversation between the source and your brain.

## Have a conversation about what you learn

Recall and spaced repetition are great, and if you're tryharding learning something I recommend doing flashcards with Anki or other software (it carried me on biochemistry class).

But one way simpler way to reinforce what you learn is talking it with someone. Anyone. You could chat with your mom, your friends, partner, classmates, some random on the internet, whoever. Talk with someone about the topic and try to explain it (you can even prompt AI to ask you questions).

This will force you to put order in your mind and craft understandable phrases. And it's better yet when the other person doesn't have much knowledge, this way you are in the best position to use the Feynmann technique.

The Feynmann technique is a learning technique consisting on teaching a subject to someone like they're kids. You have to simplify your language and talk in basic principles everyone can understand. Don't get me wrong, this is hard.

But you'll get better the more you do it. Everything is about putting in the reps. And what better way to escalate the reps than writing.

## Write about what you learn

When you write, you're forced to articulate your understanding in the same way a conversation does, but here you have more time to think. This time gives you the opportunity to find gaps in your knowledge and patch them.

These gaps of knowledge expose what you thought you knew but... you're not so sure. And recognizing what you don't know is the only way to know what to study.

Writing is thinking on paper.

Writing is thinking (!!!!)

Start writing something. Anything.

And last, but not least:

## Build a project (this is the most important)

Craft something, paint something, create something. It doesn't matter if it's pen and paper, if it's music, software, hardware, a house project or a car project. Build something.

Building something will give you WAY more understanding than consuming tutorials. Doing things with you own hands will reinforce what you know, will clear your questions and make new, better questions emerge.

And I'm not taking a no as an answer in this one, just build something for the sake of building it and learning. 

Have fun for once doing something real.

Start a journal, write an essay, sketch on a sketchbook. Start that project you've been thinking about, the worst thing that you'll get from it is learning something new.

The only difference between someone who reads a lot and someone who actually learns is that the second person takes action.

Be that second person.
