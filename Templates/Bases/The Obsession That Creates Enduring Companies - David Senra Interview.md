3:46 | Focus and working fast is everything and is repeated in the greatest entrepreneurs. Long-term focus is everything.

3:59 | They found something good to do and did it for an incredible amount of time.

4:54 | "Time is the best filter. Time is the only filter I trust."

6:17 | His favorite entrepreneur is not a tech founder, is [[Todd Graves]], the founder of Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers.

6:44 | [[Charlie Munger]] said that you're gonna half ass it if you multi-task. Do one thing at the time.

6:56 | "I didn't succeed in life because I'm intelligent, I succeeded in life because I have a long attention span"

8:49 | Everyone in technology has read zero to one. But they missed the part of what he says on it. "There's a big problem with technology companies, they optimize for growth at the expense of durability." And that has truth in it, because companies start doing more and more money in the year 3, 4, 5, 6 and up. The reason they do that is because you can track growth, but you can't track durability.

11:30 | He is heavily attracted to people who have a mission. Even if it's something like [[Todd Graves]], who believes that he has the gift of chicken fingers to help people, and he built a millionaire business and donate to charity and that kind of stuff.

12:03 | You should have to be obsessed with becoming the best at something. Whatever it is.

14:02 | Learning is not memorizing information, learning is changing your behavior ([[Humanism]]). David has learned a lot from Charlie Munger, and one thing he recalls here is "scaling down and upping the intensity gives an advantage." He took as an example Todd Graves, saying that "competitors had 10 things on the menu at the same time, I have one."

15:14 | With any great founder/entrepreneur, if you bring them a deal, and there are seven different things that have to go right, the chances of everything going right are very, very small. And here he mentioned a framework of Richard Rainwater: "You bring me your idea on a single piece of paper, explain it to me in simple words and at the end you tell me how much of your own money are you putting on these. And then I will decide if I'm gonna do this."

16:28 | There's only one thing that is important in every company. Just one.

16:34 | A lot of David's viewers are just wasting their times, because they're not changing their behavior from the podcast.

17:53 | Greatest entrepreneurs are obsessed with their businesses. He used an example of [[John D. Rockefeller]] that I loved here. "He went to one of his employees soldering oil cans and ask 'how many drops of solder are you using per can', the employee said 40, and Rockefeller asked if he tried with less, try 38. Ok, I tried 38 and it leaks. Then try 39. Oh, 39 works." So they were wasting 1 drop of solder for every can, which would not mean anything if it were a couple thousand cans, but 10, 20, 30x. Makes a huge difference. This people are obsessed with their business.

18:50 | After that, he used [[Steve Jobs]] as an example of a guy obsessed with his business. Every Wednesday, [[Steve Jobs]] had a 3-hour meeting in Apple reviewing every ad that went out. Every single one. There's an example in the book "[[Insanely Simple]]" by [[Ken Segall]] where he talked about Steve calling him on midnight and we had to talk about a single word. That's obsession. Taking what you do to extremely seriously. And David end up saying "I don't care if it's building computers, if it's making podcasts or if it's making chicken fingers. I just love people who take what you do seriously."

20:20 | The reward of great work is more work. This is the origin of the concept of Anti-business. David goes to explain how, from the beginning, the podcast name wasn't founders, was Autotellic, that means doing something for the sake of doing it.

21:43 | The hard way is the right way. Someone once told him "I have a great idea for you, what if you hire other people to read the books for you", so David told him "you don't work all your life to do what you love, to end up not doing it."

22:20 | [[Charles M. Schulz]], the guy behind Charlie Brown's character, for 40-50 years, he drew, he came up with ideas, penciled everything and crafted every single strip. It was something like 17,000 different individual strips. He had planned that when he died, there was something to put out so nobody could take over his life's work.

23:20 | When people came to the studio of [[Charles M. Schulz]] and asked who was the one doing the work, he answered: "Me". And when they responded with "why don't you hire some people so you can go on vacations", he answered "You don't work all your life to do what you love, to end up not doing it."

25:10 | David said "I know exactly what I am, and I know exactly what I'm going to do." This is an answer to people saying that he shouldn't be obsessed with it, and he was happy to read a comment that said "you know the podcast is gonna be good if the host look sleep deprived." He is not interested in anything else that is not his mission. He is focused on that one thing and only that one thing.

25:31 | He uses an example from the documentary [[The Defiant Ones]], where [[Jimmy Lovine]] said something like "when you're running after something, you know why they put blinders on horses? Cause if they look left or right they'll miss a step. And humans should have something like it too. Don't look left, don't look right. Go."

29:57 | David has said "I build this thing for me." When a podcast episode is done, he is the one listening to it. It's the same as with [[Stephen King]], who, in his words, is not just the writer, is the first reader. Same with [[Quentin Tarantino]].

33:00 | David believes that entrepreneurship is a miracle. Having the chance of turning your life around even when you have *absolutely nothing* is a miracle.

36:00 | [[Charlie Munger]] said something like "Intense interest in any subject is necessary to master it" and "follow your natural drift."

39:30 | Most probably, you won't be creating the next Apple, the next Microsoft or the next Hyundai. But you may as well learn how they built amazing products and adapt it to your own work.

42:10 | Mediocrity is invisible until passion shows up and exposes it. Most people are causal about everything, and David find this utterly disgusting. It's not about judging people, it's about filtering people who he wants to spend time with or not. His favorite people to hang out with is people who take what they do seriously.

43:00 | David don't like the over-capitalizatiopn of businesses. A lot of people who create companies, create them as financial instruments. That is fine, but those people don't have enough context or knowledge to notice that what they really want is not money, is meaning.

45:00 | You shouldn't take pride on what you consume, but in what you build. David said that mindless overconsumption and being proud of expending money is *disgusting*.

46:01 | The reason why he made clips on his podcast about anti-business, craftmanship and other is because he want to showcase the achievement of all those people.

50:10 | The creator of a product is the only one who can travel the world and showcase the product with his whole heart, and put it a high price card in it. Because there's passion behind. Examples of this are [[James Dyson]] or [[Yvon Chouinard]].

55:10 | Another piece of advice from Charlie Munger: "finding an extreme example and asking what the hell happened here." This was in the context of the Red Bull story, where the two founders bootstrapped the business putting in $500K each and some bank loans to now a 40-50 billion dollar company. He denied any chance of going public

1:03:13 | Some of the ideas David constantly repeat in his podcast are: overpay for talent, find the best people, never ever forget the dynamic range of humans, Steve Jobs says that the best person is not twice as better, is 100 and 1000 times better.

1:05:37 | In the context of capital, David mentioned that he has no friends that are not entrepreneurs, and sometimes they come to him saying "I started this software company and now I have to raise money". And there is when Senra stop them and say "you listen to the podcast, what did Steve Jobs, Bill Gates or any other big tech entrepreneur? They sold the product before the product was ready." He clarifies that he's not against raising money, but that he is anti-wastefulness.

1:14:14 | This is David Senra's definition of a Founder: It's not about being a founder of a company, is a mindset. Founders saw something missing in the world and said "this thing should exist. I'm going to make it come to life." and directed their energy into converting nothing to that thing.

1:15:01 | You can have an idea that don't know where it comes from, but it goes from your mind to real life. David says that it's disorienting, even today, that he just sat in a room by himself reading, he spoke into a microphone not knowing what was going to happen and that made something real. The act of creation is the thing he is the most proud of.
