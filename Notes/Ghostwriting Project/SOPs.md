### **CLIENT ACQUISITION (4 SOPs)**

**1. Outreach SOP**

- **What:** Daily process for identifying and messaging ideal clients
- **System:**
    - 30 min/day LinkedIn prospecting (use Sales Navigator filters: title, industry, company size)
    - Send 10 personalized DMs using this structure: "Noticed [specific observation about their content/company] → One-sentence credibility → Question about their content goals?"
    - Track in simple spreadsheet: Name, Date Contacted, Response Status, Notes
- **Why simple works:** You're not building a CRM empire. You need conversations, not data architecture.

**2. Discovery Call SOP**

- **What:** 45-min structured call to qualify and close
- **System:**
    - Minutes 1-5: Their business situation (revenue, stage, goals)
    - Minutes 6-15: Their content problem (what they've tried, why it failed)
    - Minutes 16-30: Their desired outcome (be specific: "appear in industry rankings" not "more visibility")
    - Minutes 31-40: Present your offer (show 3 samples of similar work)
    - Minutes 41-45: Close or schedule follow-up
    - Send Calendly link same day with pricing doc attached
- **Critical:** Record calls (with permission). Use transcripts to build your "voice capture" library.

**3. Proposal & Pricing SOP**

- **What:** Standard pricing tiers and proposal template
- **System:**
    - **Tier 1 ($2K/mo):** 4 LinkedIn posts/week (ghostwritten)
    - **Tier 2 ($4K/mo):** 4 posts/week + 1 long-form article/month
    - **Tier 3 ($6K/mo):** Above + newsletter + content strategy
    - Proposal template: 1-page PDF with their specific problem quoted back, your solution, deliverables, 3 testimonials, payment terms
    - Send within 24 hours of discovery call
- **Your case:** Based on your ICP, Alejandro-type clients fit Tier 2-3. They need authority positioning, not just posts.

**4. Contract & Payment SOP**

- **What:** Legal protection and getting paid upfront
- **System:**
    - Use PandaDoc or similar (templates = 5 min setup)
    - Payment: 50% upfront, 50% at month-end via Stripe/Wise
    - Signed contract = trigger to onboarding SOP
    - No exceptions on payment terms (you're not a bank)

### **CLIENT ONBOARDING (3 SOPs)**

**5. Welcome & Kickoff SOP**

- **What:** Set expectations and gather intel in first 48 hours
- **System:**
    - Day 1: Send welcome email with: timeline, deliverables, communication protocol, homework (see SOP #6)
    - Day 2: 60-min kickoff call to extract voice, stories, positioning
    - Tool: Record call, use Otter.ai for transcript
    - Deliverable: Create "Client Voice Doc" (5-10 phrases they use repeatedly, 3-5 stories they told, their POV on industry debates)

**6. Voice Capture SOP**

- **What:** Extract client's unique voice before writing word one
- **System:**
    - Send pre-call questionnaire:
        - "Send me 3 posts you loved writing and why"
        - "Send me 5 people whose content style you admire"
        - "What's one unpopular opinion you have about [their industry]?"
    - During kickoff: Ask "Can you tell me about..." questions (stories > abstractions)
    - Mine their existing content: Read last 20 posts/articles, note: sentence length, jargon level, use of questions, personal vs. company voice
    - Output: 2-page "Voice Guide" you reference for every piece

**7. Content Strategy SOP**

- **What:** Define their positioning before writing anything
- **System:**
    - Fill this one-pager with client on kickoff call:
        - Current perception: "Market sees us as..."
        - Desired perception: "We want to be known as..."
        - Proof points: "We can credibly claim this because..." (data, case studies, credentials)
        - Content pillars: 3-4 topics they'll own (e.g., "microbiome applications in agriculture, biotech scaling challenges, Chilean agtech landscape")
        - Off-limits topics: What they won't talk about
    - Use this as filter for every content idea

### **CONTENT CREATION (4 SOPs)**

**8. Content Calendar SOP**

- **What:** Plan 2 weeks ahead, never scramble
- **System:**
    - Tool: Notion, Google Sheets, or Trello (pick one, doesn't matter)
    - Every Friday: plan next 2 weeks of content
    - Format: Date | Content Type | Topic | Status | Notes
    - Source ideas from: client convos, industry news, their sales calls, competitor content gaps
    - Get client approval on topics before writing (async via Slack/email)

**9. LinkedIn Post Creation SOP**

- **What:** Ghostwrite posts that sound like them, not you
- **System:**
    - Research (15 min): Find stat/story/hook
    - Draft (20 min): Use their Voice Guide, write in Google Doc
    - Structure: Hook (1 line) → Story/Context (3-5 lines) → Insight (2-3 lines) → CTA/Question (1 line)
    - Edit (10 min): Read aloud, cut 20%, add line breaks
    - **Critical:** Every post must pass the "could they have said this in a conversation?" test
    - Submit to client in batching (4 posts at once, not daily)
    - Tool: Store approved posts in content library for voice consistency

**10. Long-Form Article SOP**

- **What:** Thought leadership pieces that establish authority
- **System:**
    - Week 1: Interview client (60 min) on article topic, get stories/data/POV
    - Week 2: Write 1200-1800 word draft (your ICP clients need depth, not fluff)
    - Structure: Strong thesis → 3 supporting arguments with data → Contrarian take → Practical application
    - Include: At least 2 original stories from client, 3-5 data points, 1 controversial opinion
    - **For biotech clients:** Explain complex science in analogies, don't dumb down but don't gatekeep
    - 2 revision rounds max (charge extra if they want more)

**11. Review & Approval SOP**

- **What:** Get client feedback without endless revisions
- **System:**
    - Submit content in batches (4 posts = 1 review session)
    - Format: Google Doc with comment permissions
    - Include: "Review by [Date]. Silence = approval."
    - 48-hour response window (put in contract)
    - Changes: Accept edits that preserve voice, push back on generic marketing speak
    - After approval: schedule posts (use Buffer/Hypefury)

### **CLIENT MANAGEMENT (2 SOPs)**

- **What:** Boundaries so clients don't drain your time
- **System:**
    - Primary: Async (Slack or email)
    - Response time: Within 24 hours on weekdays
    - Meetings: Monthly strategy call (60 min), optional mid-month check-in (30 min)
    - Emergency contact: Define what qualifies (spoiler: almost nothing does)
    - Batch responses: Check messages 3x/day (morning, noon, end of day), not constantly

**13. Monthly Reporting SOP**

- **What:** Show ROI so they renew
- **System:**
    - Send by 5th of month
    - Include: Engagement metrics (post views, comments, LinkedIn profile views), Content delivered vs. promised, Wins (mentions in articles, speaking invites, inbound leads), Next month's strategy
    - Tool: Screenshot LinkedIn analytics, put in 2-page PDF
    - **For your ICP:** Track "appeared in X ranking" or "cited by Y publication" - that's their actual KPI
