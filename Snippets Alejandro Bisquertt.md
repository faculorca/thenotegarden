Hook for a newsletter
```
I used to cut human brains for a living. 

Patients diagnosed with Parkinson's had Alzheimer's. Others with "nothing wrong" had dementia. 

You literally had to die to know what disease you had.

Hook
```
I walked 4km home crying on my birthday.

My company was shutting down December 31st. I had a 2-month-old daughter. Another failed business. No money.

I got home and broke down in front of my girlfriend.

She told me to see a psychiatrist. He gave me pills to sleep. It worked.

Sometimes you just need to admit you can't handle it alone.
